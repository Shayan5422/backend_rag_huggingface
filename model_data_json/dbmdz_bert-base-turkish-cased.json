    "description": "--- language: tr license: mit --- # ü§ó + üìö dbmdz Turkish BERT model In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State Library open sources a cased model for Turkish üéâ # üáπüá∑ BERTurk BERTurk is a community-driven cased BERT model for Turkish. Some datasets used for pretraining and evaluation are contributed from the awesome Turkish NLP community, as well as the decision for the model name: BERTurk. ## Stats The current version of the model is trained on a filtered and sentence segmented version of the Turkish OSCAR corpus, a recent Wikipedia dump, various OPUS corpora and a special corpus provided by Kemal Oflazer. The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 44,04,976,662 tokens. Thanks to Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC) we could train a cased model on a TPU v3-8 for 2M steps. ## Model weights Currently only PyTorch-Transformers compatible weights are available.
