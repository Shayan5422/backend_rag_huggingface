To pre-train the different variations of LEGAL-BERT, we collected 12 GB of diverse English legal text from several fields (e.g., legislation, court cases, contracts) scraped from publicly available resources. Sub-domain variants (CONTRACTS-, EURLEX-, ECHR-) and/or general LEGAL-BERT perform better than using BERT out of the box for domain-specific tasks. A light-weight model (33% the size of BERT-BASE) pre-trained from scratch on legal data with competitive performance is also available. <br/><br/> --- I. Chalkidis, M. Fergadiotis, P. Malakasiotis, N. Aletras and I. Androutsopoulos. \"LEGAL-BERT: The Muppets straight out of Law School\". In Findings of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2020) (Short Papers), to be held online, 2020. ( --- ## Pre-training corpora The pre-training corpora of LEGAL-BERT include: * 116,062 documents of EU legislation, publicly available from EURLEX ( the repository of EU Law running under the EU Publication Office. * 61,826 documents of UK legislation, publicly available from the UK legislation portal ( * 19,867 cases from the European Court of Justice (ECJ), also available from EURLEX. * 12,554 cases from HUDOC, the repository of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ( * 164,141 cases from various courts across the USA, hosted in the Case Law Access Project portal ( * 76,366 US contracts from EDGAR, the database of US Securities and Exchange Commission (SECOM) ( ## Pre-training details * We trained BERT using the official code provided in Google BERT's GitHub repository ( * We released a model similar to the English BERT-BASE model (12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters). * We chose to follow the same training set-up: 1 million training steps with batches of 256 sequences of length 512 with an initial learning rate 1e-4. * We were able to use a single Google Cloud TPU v3-8 provided for free from TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC), while also utilizing GCP research credits. Huge thanks to both Google programs for supporting us! * Part of LEGAL-BERT is a light-weight model pre-trained from scratch on legal data, which achieves comparable performance to larger models, while being much more efficient (approximately 4 times faster) with a smaller environmental footprint. ## Models list | Model name | Model Path | Training corpora | | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | | CONTRACTS-BERT-BASE | | US contracts | | EURLEX-BERT-BASE | | EU legislation | | ECHR-BERT-BASE | | ECHR cases | | LEGAL-BERT-BASE * | | All | | LEGAL-BERT-SMALL | | All | \\* LEGAL-BERT-BASE is the model referred to as LEGAL-BERT-SC in Chalkidis et al. (2020); a model trained from scratch in the legal corpora mentioned below using a newly created vocabulary by a sentence-piece tokenizer trained on the very same corpora. \\*\\* As many of you expressed interest in the LEGAL-BERT-FP models (those relying on the original BERT-BASE checkpoint), they have been released in Archive.org ( as these models are secondary and possibly only interesting for those who aim to dig deeper in the open questions of Chalkidis et al. (2020). ## Load Pretrained Model ## Use LEGAL-BERT variants as Language Models | Corpus | Model | Masked token | Predictions | | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | | | **BERT-BASE-UNCASED** | | (Contracts) | This [MASK] Agreement is between General Motors and John Murray . | employment | ('new', '0.09'), ('current', '0.04'), ('proposed', '0.03'), ('marketing', '0.03'), ('joint', '0.02') | (ECHR) | The applicant submitted that her husband was subjected to treatment amounting to [MASK] whilst in the custody of Adana Security Directorate | torture | ('torture', '0.32'), ('rape', '0.22'), ('abuse', '0.14'), ('death', '0.04'), ('violence', '0.03') | (EURLEX) | Establishing a system for the identification and registration of [MASK] animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products . | bovine | ('farm', '0.25'), ('livestock', '0.08'), ('draft', '0.06'), ('domestic', '0.05'), ('wild', '0.05') | | **CONTRACTS-BERT-BASE** | | (Contracts) | This [MASK] Agreement is between General Motors and John Murray . | employment | ('letter', '0.38'), ('dealer', '0.04'), ('employment', '0.03'), ('award', '0.03'), ('contribution', '0.02') | (ECHR) | The applicant submitted that her husband was subjected to treatment amounting to [MASK] whilst in the custody of Adana Security Directorate | torture | ('death', '0.39'), ('imprisonment', '0.07'), ('contempt', '0.05'), ('being', '0.03'), ('crime', '0.02') | (EURLEX) | Establishing a system for the identification and registration of [MASK] animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products . | bovine | (('domestic', '0.18'), ('laboratory', '0.07'), ('household', '0.06'), ('personal', '0.06'), ('the', '0.04') | | **EURLEX-BERT-BASE** | | (Contracts) | This [MASK] Agreement is between General Motors and John Murray . | employment | ('supply', '0.11'), ('cooperation', '0.08'), ('service', '0.07'), ('licence', '0.07'), ('distribution', '0.05') | (ECHR) | The applicant submitted that her husband was subjected to treatment amounting to [MASK] whilst in the custody of Adana Security Directorate | torture | ('torture', '0.66'), ('death', '0.07'), ('imprisonment', '0.07'), ('murder', '0.04'), ('rape', '0.02') | (EURLEX) | Establishing a system for the identification and registration of [MASK] animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products . | bovine | ('live', '0.43'), ('pet', '0.28'), ('certain', '0.05'), ('fur', '0.03'), ('the', '0.02') | | **ECHR-BERT-BASE** | | (Contracts) | This [MASK] Agreement is between General Motors and John Murray . | employment | ('second', '0.24'), ('latter', '0.10'), ('draft', '0.05'), ('bilateral', '0.05'), ('arbitration', '0.04') | (ECHR) | The applicant submitted that her husband was subjected to treatment amounting to [MASK] whilst in the custody of Adana Security Directorate | torture | ('torture', '0.99'), ('death', '0.01'), ('inhuman', '0.00'), ('beating', '0.00'), ('rape', '0.00') | (EURLEX) | Establishing a system for the identification and registration of [MASK] animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products . | bovine | ('pet', '0.17'), ('all', '0.12'), ('slaughtered', '0.10'), ('domestic', '0.07'), ('individual', '0.05') | | **LEGAL-BERT-BASE** | | (Contracts) | This [MASK] Agreement is between General Motors and John Murray . | employment | ('settlement', '0.26'), ('letter', '0.23'), ('dealer', '0.04'), ('master', '0.02'), ('supplemental', '0.02') | (ECHR) | The applicant submitted that her husband was subjected to treatment amounting to [MASK] whilst in the custody of Adana Security Directorate | torture | ('torture', '1.00'), ('detention', '0.00'), ('arrest', '0.00'), ('rape', '0.00'), ('death', '0.00') | (EURLEX) | Establishing a system for the identification and registration of [MASK] animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products . | bovine | ('live', '0.67'), ('beef', '0.17'), ('farm', '0.03'), ('pet', '0.02'), ('dairy', '0.01') | | **LEGAL-BERT-SMALL** | | (Contracts) | This [MASK] Agreement is between General Motors and John Murray . | employment | ('license', '0.09'), ('transition', '0.08'), ('settlement', '0.04'), ('consent', '0.03'), ('letter', '0.03') | (ECHR) | The applicant submitted that her husband was subjected to treatment amounting to [MASK] whilst in the custody of Adana Security Directorate | torture | ('torture', '0.59'), ('pain', '0.05'), ('ptsd', '0.05'), ('death', '0.02'), ('tuberculosis', '0.02') | (EURLEX) | Establishing a system for the identification and registration of [MASK] animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products . | bovine | ('all', '0.08'), ('live', '0.07'), ('certain', '0.07'), ('the', '0.07'), ('farm', '0.05') ## Evaluation on downstream tasks Consider the experiments in the article \"LEGAL-BERT: The Muppets straight out of Law School\".
