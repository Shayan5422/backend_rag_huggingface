We also provide an interactive demo on Hugging Face Spaces. - **Jul 2024 (v2):** We release BigVGAN-v2 along with pretrained checkpoints. Below are the highlights: - Custom CUDA kernel for inference: we provide a fused upsampling + activation kernel written in CUDA for accelerated inference speed. Our test shows 1.5 - 3x faster speed on a single A100 GPU. - Improved discriminator and loss: BigVGAN-v2 is trained using a multi-scale sub-band CQT discriminator and a multi-scale mel spectrogram loss. - Larger training data: BigVGAN-v2 is trained using datasets containing diverse audio types, including speech in multiple languages, environmental sounds, and instruments. - We provide pretrained checkpoints of BigVGAN-v2 using diverse audio configurations, supporting up to 44 kHz sampling rate and 512x upsampling ratio. ## Installation This repository contains pretrained BigVGAN checkpoints with easy access to inference and additional support. If you are interested in training the model and additional functionalities, please visit the official GitHub repository for more information: ## Usage Below example describes how you can use BigVGAN: load the pretrained BigVGAN generator from Hugging Face Hub, compute mel spectrogram from input waveform, and generate synthesized waveform using the mel spectrogram as the model's input. ## Using Custom CUDA Kernel for Synthesis You can apply the fast CUDA inference kernel by using a parameter when instantiating BigVGAN: When applied for the first time, it builds the kernel using and . If the build succeeds, the kernel is saved to and the model automatically loads the kernel. The codebase has been tested using CUDA . Please make sure that both are installed in your system and installed in your system matches the version your PyTorch build is using. For detail, see the official GitHub repository: ## Pretrained Models We provide the pretrained models on Hugging Face Collections. One can download the checkpoints of the generator weight (named ) and its discriminator/optimizer states (named ) within the listed model repositories. | Model Name | Sampling Rate | Mel band | fmax | Upsampling Ratio | Params | Dataset | Steps | Fine-Tuned | |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----:|:----------------:|:------:|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:----------:| | bigvgan_v2_44khz_128band_512x | 44 kHz | 128 | 22050 | 512 | 122M | Large-scale Compilation | 5M | No | | bigvgan_v2_44khz_128band_256x | 44 kHz | 128 | 22050 | 256 | 112M | Large-scale Compilation | 5M | No | | bigvgan_v2_24khz_100band_256x | 24 kHz | 100 | 12000 | 256 | 112M | Large-scale Compilation | 5M | No | | bigvgan_v2_22khz_80band_256x | 22 kHz | 80 | 11025 | 256 | 112M | Large-scale Compilation | 5M | No | | bigvgan_v2_22khz_80band_fmax8k_256x | 22 kHz | 80 | 8000 | 256 | 112M | Large-scale Compilation | 5M | No | | bigvgan_24khz_100band | 24 kHz | 100 | 12000 | 256 | 112M | LibriTTS | 5M | No | | bigvgan_base_24khz_100band | 24 kHz | 100 | 12000 | 256 | 14M | LibriTTS | 5M | No | | bigvgan_22khz_80band | 22 kHz | 80 | 8000 | 256 | 112M | LibriTTS + VCTK + LJSpeech | 5M | No | | bigvgan_base_22khz_80band | 22 kHz | 80 | 8000 | 256 | 14M | LibriTTS + VCTK + LJSpeech | 5M | No |",
