It is a \"large\" version of TitaNet (around 23M parameters) models. See the model architecture section and NeMo documentation for complete architecture details. ## NVIDIA NeMo: Training To train, fine-tune or play with the model you will need to install NVIDIA NeMo. We recommend you install it after you've installed the latest Pytorch version. ## How to Use this Model The model is available for use in the NeMo toolkit [3] and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset. ### Automatically instantiate the model ### Embedding Extraction Using ### Verifying two utterances (Speaker Verification) Now to check if two audio files are from the same speaker or not, simply do: ### Extracting Embeddings for more audio files To extract embeddings from a bunch of audio files: Write audio files to a file with lines as in format: Then running following script will extract embeddings and writes to current working directory: ### Input This model accepts 16000 KHz Mono-channel Audio (wav files) as input. ### Output This model provides speaker embeddings for an audio file. ## Model Architecture TitaNet model is a depth-wise separable conv1D model [1] for Speaker Verification and diarization tasks. You may find more info on the detail of this model here: TitaNet-Model. ## Training The NeMo toolkit [3] was used for training the models for over several hundred epochs. These model are trained with this example script and this base config. ### Datasets All the models in this collection are trained on a composite dataset comprising several thousand hours of English speech: - Voxceleb-1 - Voxceleb-2 - Fisher - Switchboard - Librispeech - SRE (2004-2010) ## Performance Performances of the these models are reported in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER%) on speaker verification evaluation trial files and as Diarization Error Rate (DER%) on diarization test sessions. * Speaker Verification (EER%) | Version | Model | Model Size | VoxCeleb1 (Cleaned trial file) | |---------|--------------|-----|---------------| | 1.10.0 | TitaNet-Large | 23M | 0.66 | * Speaker Diarization (DER%) | Version | Model | Model Size | Evaluation Condition | NIST SRE 2000 | AMI (Lapel) | AMI (MixHeadset) | CH109 | |---------|--------------|-----|----------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------| | 1.10.0 | TitaNet-Large | 23M | Oracle VAD KNOWN # of Speakers | 6.73 | 2.03 | 1.73 | 1.19 | | 1.10.0 | TitaNet-Large | 23M | Oracle VAD UNKNOWN # of Speakers | 5.38 | 2.03 | 1.89 | 1.63 | ## Limitations This model is trained on both telephonic and non-telephonic speech from voxceleb datasets, Fisher and switch board. If your domain of data differs from trained data or doesnot show relatively good performance consider finetuning for that speech domain. ## NVIDIA Riva: Deployment NVIDIA Riva, is an accelerated speech AI SDK deployable on-prem, in all clouds, multi-cloud, hybrid, on edge, and embedded. Additionally, Riva provides: * World-class out-of-the-box accuracy for the most common languages with model checkpoints trained on proprietary data with hundreds of thousands of GPU-compute hours * Best in class accuracy with run-time word boosting (e.g., brand and product names) and customization of acoustic model, language model, and inverse text normalization * Streaming speech recognition, Kubernetes compatible scaling, and enterprise-grade support Although this model isnâ€™t supported yet by Riva, the list of supported models is here.
