It is in homage to this divine mediator that I name this advanced LLM \"Hermes,\" a system crafted to navigate the complex intricacies of human discourse with celestial finesse.* ## Model description OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B is a state of the art Mistral Fine-tune, a continuation of OpenHermes 2 model, which trained on additional code datasets. Potentially the most interesting finding from training on a good ratio (est. of around 7-14% of the total dataset) of code instruction was that it has boosted several non-code benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, AGIEval, and GPT4All suite. It did however reduce BigBench benchmark score, but the net gain overall is significant. The code it trained on also improved it's humaneval score (benchmarking done by Glaive team) from **43% @ Pass 1** with Open Herms 2 to **50.7% @ Pass 1** with Open Hermes 2.5. OpenHermes was trained on 1,000,000 entries of primarily GPT-4 generated data, as well as other high quality data from open datasets across the AI landscape. [More details soon] Filtering was extensive of these public datasets, as well as conversion of all formats to ShareGPT, which was then further transformed by axolotl to use ChatML. Huge thank you to GlaiveAI and a16z for compute access and for sponsoring my work, and all the dataset creators and other people who's work has contributed to this project!

That said, code capabilities had a decent jump alongside the overall capabilities of the model: Glaive performed HumanEval testing on Hermes-2.5 and found a score of: **50.7% @ Pass1** !image/png # Prompt Format OpenHermes 2.5 now uses ChatML as the prompt format, opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue. System prompts are now a thing that matters! Hermes 2.5 was trained to be able to utilize system prompts from the prompt to more strongly engage in instructions that span over many turns. This is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns. This format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI. Prompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!): This prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the method: When tokenizing messages for generation, set when calling . This will append to your prompt, to ensure that the model continues with an assistant response. To utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out. Currently, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box. In LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane: !image/png # Quantized Models: GGUF: GPTQ: AWQ: EXL2: <img src=\" alt=\"Built with Axolotl\" width=\"200\" height=\"32\"/>",
