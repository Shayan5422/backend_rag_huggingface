    "description": "--- pipeline_tag: sentence-similarity tags: - sentence-transformers - feature-extraction - sentence-similarity - transformers language: ko --- # ko-sroberta-multitask This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search. <!--- Describe your model here --> ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) Using this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed: Then you can use the model like this: ## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers) Without sentence-transformers, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings. ## Evaluation Results <!--- Describe how your model was evaluated --> KorSTS, KorNLI 학습 데이터셋으로 멀티 태스크 학습을 진행한 후 KorSTS 평가 데이터셋으로 평가한 결과입니다. - Cosine Pearson: 84.77 - Cosine Spearman: 85.60 - Euclidean Pearson: 83.71 - Euclidean Spearman: 84.40 - Manhattan Pearson: 83.70 - Manhattan Spearman: 84.38 - Dot Pearson: 82.42 - Dot Spearman: 82.33 ## Training The model was trained with the parameters: **DataLoader**: of length 8885 with parameters: **Loss**: with parameters: **DataLoader**: of length 719 with parameters: **Loss**: Parameters of the fit()-Method: ## Full Model Architecture ## Citing & Authors <!--- Describe where people can find more information --> - Ham, J., Choe, Y.
