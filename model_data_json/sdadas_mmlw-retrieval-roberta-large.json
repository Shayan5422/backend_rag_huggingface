This model is optimized for information retrieval tasks. It can transform queries and passages to 1024 dimensional vectors. The model was developed using a two-step procedure: - In the first step, it was initialized with Polish RoBERTa checkpoint, and then trained with multilingual knowledge distillation method on a diverse corpus of 60 million Polish-English text pairs. We utilised English FlagEmbeddings (BGE) as teacher models for distillation. - The second step involved fine-tuning the obtained models with contrastrive loss on Polish MS MARCO training split. In order to improve the efficiency of contrastive training, we used large batch sizes - 1152 for small, 768 for base, and 288 for large models. Fine-tuning was conducted on a cluster of 12 A100 GPUs. ⚠️ **2023-12-26:** We have updated the model to a new version with improved results. You can still download the previous version using the **v1** tag: ⚠️ ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) ⚠️ Our dense retrievers require the use of specific prefixes and suffixes when encoding texts. For this model, each query should be preceded by the prefix **\"zapytanie: \"** ⚠️ You can use the model like this with sentence-transformers: ## Evaluation Results The model achieves **NDCG@10** of **58.46** on the Polish Information Retrieval Benchmark. See PIRB Leaderboard for detailed results. ## Acknowledgements This model was trained with the A100 GPU cluster support delivered by the Gdansk University of Technology within the TASK center initiative. ## Citation",
