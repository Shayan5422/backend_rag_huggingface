This model is part of the OPUS-MT project, an effort to make neural machine translation models widely available and accessible for many languages in the world. All models are originally trained using the amazing framework of Marian NMT, an efficient NMT implementation written in pure C++. The models have been converted to pyTorch using the transformers library by huggingface. Training data is taken from OPUS and training pipelines use the procedures of OPUS-MT-train. * Publications: OPUS-MT – Building open translation services for the World and The Tatoeba Translation Challenge – Realistic Data Sets for Low Resource and Multilingual MT (Please, cite if you use this model.) ## Model info * Release: 2022-02-25 * source language(s): eng * target language(s): tur * model: transformer-big * data: opusTCv20210807+bt (source) * tokenization: SentencePiece (spm32k,spm32k) * original model: opusTCv20210807+bt_transformer-big_2022-02-25.zip * more information released models: OPUS-MT eng-tur README ## Usage A short example code: You can also use OPUS-MT models with the transformers pipelines, for example: ## Benchmarks * test set translations: opusTCv20210807+bt_transformer-big_2022-02-25.test.txt * test set scores: opusTCv20210807+bt_transformer-big_2022-02-25.eval.txt * benchmark results: benchmark_results.txt * benchmark output: benchmark_translations.zip | langpair | testset | chr-F | BLEU | #sent | #words | |----------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------| | eng-tur | tatoeba-test-v2021-08-07 | 0.68726 | 42.3 | 13907 | 84364 | | eng-tur | flores101-devtest | 0.62829 | 31.4 | 1012 | 20253 | | eng-tur | newsdev2016 | 0.58947 | 21.9 | 1001 | 15958 | | eng-tur | newstest2016 | 0.57624 | 23.4 | 3000 | 50782 | | eng-tur | newstest2017 | 0.58858 | 25.4 | 3007 | 51977 | | eng-tur | newstest2018 | 0.57848 | 22.6 | 3000 | 53731 | ## Acknowledgements The work is supported by the European Language Grid as pilot project 2866, by the FoTran project, funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 771113), and the MeMAD project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No 780069.
