Expect the final final to be much more powerful than the current one. ## Finetuning Code Coming Soon!!! ## Usage You can use with with the following script: ## Prompt Format The model follow the ChatML standard, however, without at the end of : --- | Image | Example | |--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | !small | **What is the text saying?** <br> \"Small but mighty\". <br>**How does the text correlate to the context of the image?** <br> The text seems to be a playful or humorous representation of a small but mighty figure, possibly a mouse or a mouse toy, holding a weightlifting bar. | --- Model is trained using a modified version from Bunny",
