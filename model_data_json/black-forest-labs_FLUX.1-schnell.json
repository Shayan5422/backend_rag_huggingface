    "description": "--- language: - en license: apache-2.0 tags: - text-to-image - image-generation - flux --- ![FLUX.1 [schnell] Grid](./schnell_grid.jpeg) is a 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer capable of generating images from text descriptions. For more information, please read our blog post. # Key Features 1. Cutting-edge output quality and competitive prompt following, matching the performance of closed source alternatives. 2. Trained using latent adversarial diffusion distillation, can generate high-quality images in only 1 to 4 steps. 3. Released under the licence, the model can be used for personal, scientific, and commercial purposes. # Usage We provide a reference implementation of , as well as sampling code, in a dedicated github repository. Developers and creatives looking to build on top of are encouraged to use this as a starting point. ## API Endpoints The FLUX.1 models are also available via API from the following sources - bfl.ml (currently ) - replicate.com - fal.ai - mystic.ai ## ComfyUI is also available in Comfy UI for local inference with a node-based workflow. ## Diffusers To use with the ðŸ§¨ diffusers python library, first install or upgrade diffusers Then you can use to run the model To learn more check out the diffusers documentation --- # Limitations - This model is not intended or able to provide factual information. - As a statistical model this checkpoint might amplify existing societal biases. - The model may fail to generate output that matches the prompts. - Prompt following is heavily influenced by the prompting-style. # Out-of-Scope Use The model and its derivatives may not be used - In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local or international law or regulation. - For the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way; including but not limited to the solicitation, creation, acquisition, or dissemination of child exploitative content. - To generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others. - To generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used to harm an individual. - To harass, abuse, threaten, stalk, or bully individuals or groups of individuals. - To create non-consensual nudity or illegal pornographic content. - For fully automated decision making that adversely impacts an individual's legal rights or otherwise creates or modifies a binding, enforceable obligation. - Generating or facilitating large-scale disinformation campaigns."
