    "description": "--- license: apache-2.0 tags: - dino - vision inference: false --- # Vision Transformer (base-sized model) trained using DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) model trained using the DINOv2 method. It was introduced in the paper DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision by Oquab et al. and first released in this repository. Disclaimer: The team releasing DINOv2 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team. ## Model description The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion. Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches, which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. Note that this model does not include any fine-tuned heads. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image. ## Intended uses & limitations You can use the raw model for feature extraction. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you. ### How to use Here is how to use this model: ### BibTeX entry and citation info",
