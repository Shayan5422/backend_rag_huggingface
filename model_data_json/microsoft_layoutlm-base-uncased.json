LayoutLM archives the SOTA results on multiple datasets. For more details, please refer to our paper: LayoutLM: Pre-training of Text and Layout for Document Image Understanding Yiheng Xu, Minghao Li, Lei Cui, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei, Ming Zhou, KDD 2020 ## Training data We pre-train LayoutLM on IIT-CDIP Test Collection 1.0\\* dataset with two settings. * LayoutLM-Base, Uncased (11M documents, 2 epochs): 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 113M parameters **(This Model)** * LayoutLM-Large, Uncased (11M documents, 2 epochs): 24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 343M parameters ## Citation If you find LayoutLM useful in your research, please cite the following paper:",
