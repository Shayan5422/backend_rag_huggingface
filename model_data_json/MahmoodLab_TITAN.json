It leverages 335,645 whole-slide images (WSIs) from a diverse set of internally collected neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory cases at Mass General Brigham. Additionally, TITAN utilizes over 182,000 pathology reports and more than 423,000 synthetic captions generated by PathChat, our pathology co-pilot. TITAN's slide embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse downstream tasks, including linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval, cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation. This is a preview and we will bring you further updates and improvements. **your request will be denied**.

Other reasons for your request access being denied include other mistakes in the form submitted, for example: full name includes abbreviations, affiliation is not spelled out, the described research use is not sufficient, or email domain address not recognized. ## Model Description - **Developed by:** Mahmood Lab AI for Pathology @ Harvard/BWH - **Model type:** Pretrained vision-language encoders - **Pretraining dataset:** Mass-340K, sourced from private histology collections (BWH / MGH), in addition to slides from the public GTEx consortium. - **Repository:** - **Preprint:** - **License:** CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 ### Requirements ### Model Usage TITAN-preview is a vision-lanuage model trained on CONCH v1.5 patch features with patch size of 512x512 pixels at 20x magnification. Following authentication (using ), both TITAN-preview (slide and language encoders) and CONCH v1.5 (patch encoder) can be loaded using the commands below: You can directly use TITAN-preview for slide-level feature extaction. TITAN builds a feature grids from CONCH v1.5 patch features using the coordinates and the distance between the patches. As patch coordinates are always saved at the slides' level 0 magnification, TITAN takes patch_size_lv0 which represents the distance between two adjacent patches at level 0 magnification. It is 1024 if slide is 40x, or 512 if slide is 20x. We have this info saved in our demo TCGA features. Slide-level feature extraction can be done in the following way: These pre-extracted features can then be used for slide-level classification (via linear probing), retrieval (via l2 distance), and other machine learning settings, without task-specific finetuning. We also released all TCGA TITAN-preview features in . We demonstrated more detailed linear probe and zero-shot evaluation in our github. ## License and Terms of Use This model and associated code are released under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license and may only be used for non-commercial, academic research purposes with proper attribution.
