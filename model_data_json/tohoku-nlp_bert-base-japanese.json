This version of the model processes input texts with word-level tokenization based on the IPA dictionary, followed by the WordPiece subword tokenization. The codes for the pretraining are available at cl-tohoku/bert-japanese. ## Model architecture The model architecture is the same as the original BERT base model; 12 layers, 768 dimensions of hidden states, and 12 attention heads. ## Training Data The model is trained on Japanese Wikipedia as of September 1, 2019. To generate the training corpus, WikiExtractor is used to extract plain texts from a dump file of Wikipedia articles. The text files used for the training are 2.6GB in size, consisting of approximately 17M sentences. ## Tokenization The texts are first tokenized by MeCab morphological parser with the IPA dictionary and then split into subwords by the WordPiece algorithm. The vocabulary size is 32000. ## Training The model is trained with the same configuration as the original BERT; 512 tokens per instance, 256 instances per batch, and 1M training steps. ## Licenses The pretrained models are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. ## Acknowledgments For training models, we used Cloud TPUs provided by TensorFlow Research Cloud program.",
