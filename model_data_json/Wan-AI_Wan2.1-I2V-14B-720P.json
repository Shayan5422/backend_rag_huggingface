It can generate a 5-second 480P video on an RTX 4090 in about 4 minutes (without optimization techniques like quantization). Its performance is even comparable to some closed-source models. - üëç **Multiple Tasks**: **Wan2.1** excels in Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video Editing, Text-to-Image, and Video-to-Audio, advancing the field of video generation. - üëç **Visual Text Generation**: **Wan2.1** is the first video model capable of generating both Chinese and English text, featuring robust text generation that enhances its practical applications. - üëç **Powerful Video VAE**: **Wan-VAE** delivers exceptional efficiency and performance, encoding and decoding 1080P videos of any length while preserving temporal information, making it an ideal foundation for video and image generation. This repository contains our I2V-14B model, which is capable of generating 720P high-definition videos. After thousands of rounds of human evaluations, this model has outperformed both closed-source and open-source alternatives, achieving state-of-the-art performance. ## Video Demos <div align=\"center\"> <video width=\"80%\" controls> <source src=\" type=\"video/mp4\"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> </div> ## üî• Latest News!! * Feb 25, 2025: üëã We've released the inference code and weights of Wan2.1. ## üìë Todo List - Wan2.1 Text-to-Video - [x] Multi-GPU Inference code of the 14B and 1.3B models - [x] Checkpoints of the 14B and 1.3B models - [x] Gradio demo - [ ] Diffusers integration - [ ] ComfyUI integration - Wan2.1 Image-to-Video - [x] Multi-GPU Inference code of the 14B model - [x] Checkpoints of the 14B model - [x] Gradio demo - [ ] Diffusers integration - [ ] ComfyUI integration ## Quickstart #### Installation Clone the repo: Install dependencies: #### Model Download | Models | Download Link | Notes | | --------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------| | T2V-14B | ü§ó Huggingface ü§ñ ModelScope | Supports both 480P and 720P | I2V-14B-720P | ü§ó Huggingface ü§ñ ModelScope | Supports 720P | I2V-14B-480P | ü§ó Huggingface ü§ñ ModelScope | Supports 480P | T2V-1.3B | ü§ó Huggingface ü§ñ ModelScope | Supports 480P > üí°Note: The 1.3B model is capable of generating videos at 720P resolution.

These include our novel spatio-temporal variational autoencoder (VAE), scalable training strategies, large-scale data construction, and automated evaluation metrics. Collectively, these contributions enhance the model‚Äôs performance and versatility. ##### (1) 3D Variational Autoencoders We propose a novel 3D causal VAE architecture, termed **Wan-VAE** specifically designed for video generation. By combining multiple strategies, we improve spatio-temporal compression, reduce memory usage, and ensure temporal causality. **Wan-VAE** demonstrates significant advantages in performance efficiency compared to other open-source VAEs. Furthermore, our **Wan-VAE** can encode and decode unlimited-length 1080P videos without losing historical temporal information, making it particularly well-suited for video generation tasks. <div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"assets/video_vae_res.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 80%;\" /> </div> ##### (2) Video Diffusion DiT **Wan2.1** is designed using the Flow Matching framework within the paradigm of mainstream Diffusion Transformers. Our model's architecture uses the T5 Encoder to encode multilingual text input, with cross-attention in each transformer block embedding the text into the model structure. Additionally, we employ an MLP with a Linear layer and a SiLU layer to process the input time embeddings and predict six modulation parameters individually. This MLP is shared across all transformer blocks, with each block learning a distinct set of biases. Our experimental findings reveal a significant performance improvement with this approach at the same parameter scale. <div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"assets/video_dit_arch.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 80%;\" /> </div> | Model | Dimension | Input Dimension | Output Dimension | Feedforward Dimension | Frequency Dimension | Number of Heads | Number of Layers | |--------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------| | 1.3B | 1536 | 16 | 16 | 8960 | 256 | 12 | 30 | | 14B | 5120 | 16 | 16 | 13824 | 256 | 40 | 40 | ##### Data We curated and deduplicated a candidate dataset comprising a vast amount of image and video data. During the data curation process, we designed a four-step data cleaning process, focusing on fundamental dimensions, visual quality and motion quality. Through the robust data processing pipeline, we can easily obtain high-quality, diverse, and large-scale training sets of images and videos. !figure1 ##### Comparisons to SOTA We compared **Wan2.1** with leading open-source and closed-source models to evaluate the performace. Using our carefully designed set of 1,035 internal prompts, we tested across 14 major dimensions and 26 sub-dimensions. We then compute the total score by performing a weighted calculation on the scores of each dimension, utilizing weights derived from human preferences in the matching process. The detailed results are shown in the table below. These results demonstrate our model's superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models. !figure1 ## Citation If you find our work helpful, please cite us. ## License Agreement The models in this repository are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
