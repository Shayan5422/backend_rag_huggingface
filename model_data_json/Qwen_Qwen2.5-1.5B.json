For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2: - Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains. - Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots. - **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens. - **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. **This repo contains the base 1.5B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features: - Type: Causal Language Models - Training Stage: Pretraining - Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, Attention QKV bias and tied word embeddings - Number of Parameters: 1.54B - Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 1.31B - Number of Layers: 28 - Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 12 for Q and 2 for KV - Context Length: Full 32,768 tokens **We do not recommend using base language models for conversations.** Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., on this model. For more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation. ## Requirements The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face and we advise you to use the latest version of . With , you will encounter the following error: ## Evaluation & Performance Detailed evaluation results are reported in this 📑 blog. For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results here. ## Citation If you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.",
    "model_explanation_gemini": "A 1.5B parameter causal language model optimized for text generation, featuring improved coding, mathematics, multilingual support (29 languages), long-context handling (32K tokens), and structured data understanding, designed for post-training adaptation rather than direct conversational use."
