Please see japanese-clip for the other available models. # How to use the model 1. Install package 2. Run # Model architecture The model was trained a ViT-B/16 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a 12-layer BERT as a text encoder. The image encoder was initialized from the AugReg model. # Training The model was trained on CC12M translated the captions to Japanese. # Release date May 12, 2022 # How to cite # License The Apache 2.0 license",
