Introduction of Deepseek LLM Introducing DeepSeek LLM, an advanced language model comprising 7 billion parameters. It has been trained from scratch on a vast dataset of 2 trillion tokens in both English and Chinese. In order to foster research, we have made DeepSeek LLM 7B/67B Base and DeepSeek LLM 7B/67B Chat open source for the research community. ### 2. Model Summary is a 7B parameter model initialized from and fine-tuned on extra instruction data. - **Home Page:** DeepSeek - **Repository:** deepseek-ai/deepseek-LLM - **Chat With DeepSeek LLM:** DeepSeek-LLM ### 3. How to Use Here give some examples of how to use our model. #### Chat Completion Avoiding the use of the provided function , you can also interact with our model following the sample template. Note that should be replaced by your input. **Note:** By default (), our tokenizer automatically adds a () before the input text. Additionally, since the system prompt is not compatible with this version of our models, we DO NOT RECOMMEND including the system prompt in your input. ### 4.
