If you touch the handle, if its hot there might be a fire down the hallway!\" example_title: \"Panic protocol\" --- <center> <a href=\" <img src=\" </a> </center> Dia is a 1.6B parameter text to speech model created by Nari Labs. It was pushed to the Hub using the PytorchModelHubMixin integration. Dia **directly generates highly realistic dialogue from a transcript**. You can condition the output on audio, enabling emotion and tone control. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughter, coughing, clearing throat, etc. To accelerate research, we are providing access to pretrained model checkpoints and inference code. The model weights are hosted on Hugging Face. The model only supports English generation at the moment. We also provide a demo page comparing our model to ElevenLabs Studio and Sesame CSM-1B. - (Update) We have a ZeroGPU Space running! Try it now here. Thanks to the HF team for the support :) - Join our discord server for community support and access to new features. - Play with a larger version of Dia: generate fun conversations, remix content, and share with friends. üîÆ Join the waitlist for early access. ## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart This will open a Gradio UI that you can work on. or if you do not have pre-installed: Note that the model was not fine-tuned on a specific voice. Hence, you will get different voices every time you run the model. You can keep speaker consistency by either adding an audio prompt (a guide coming VERY soon - try it with the second example on Gradio for now), or fixing the seed. ## Features - Generate dialogue via and tag - Generate non-verbal like , , etc. - Below verbal tags will be recognized, but might result in unexpected output. - - Voice cloning. See [](example/voice_clone.py) for more information. - In the Hugging Face space, you can upload the audio you want to clone and place its transcript before your script. Make sure the transcript follows the required format. The model will then output only the content of your script. ## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage ### As a Python Library A pypi package and a working CLI tool will be available soon. ## üíª Hardware and Inference Speed Dia has been tested on only GPUs (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.6). CPU support is to be added soon. The initial run will take longer as the Descript Audio Codec also needs to be downloaded. On enterprise GPUs, Dia can generate audio in real-time. On older GPUs, inference time will be slower. For reference, on a A4000 GPU, Dia roughly generates 40 tokens/s (86 tokens equals 1 second of audio). will increase speeds for supported GPUs. The full version of Dia requires around 10GB of VRAM to run. We will be adding a quantized version in the future.
