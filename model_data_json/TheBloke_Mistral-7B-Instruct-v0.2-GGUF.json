These files were quantised using hardware kindly provided by Massed Compute. <!-- description end --> <!-- README_GGUF.md-about-gguf start --> ### About GGUF GGUF is a new format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21st 2023. It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp. Here is an incomplete list of clients and libraries that are known to support GGUF: * llama.cpp. The source project for GGUF. Offers a CLI and a server option. * text-generation-webui, the most widely used web UI, with many features and powerful extensions. Supports GPU acceleration. * KoboldCpp, a fully featured web UI, with GPU accel across all platforms and GPU architectures. Especially good for story telling. * GPT4All, a free and open source local running GUI, supporting Windows, Linux and macOS with full GPU accel. * LM Studio, an easy-to-use and powerful local GUI for Windows and macOS (Silicon), with GPU acceleration. Linux available, in beta as of 27/11/2023. * LoLLMS Web UI, a great web UI with many interesting and unique features, including a full model library for easy model selection. * Faraday.dev, an attractive and easy to use character-based chat GUI for Windows and macOS (both Silicon and Intel), with GPU acceleration. * llama-cpp-python, a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server. * candle, a Rust ML framework with a focus on performance, including GPU support, and ease of use. * ctransformers, a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible AI server. Note, as of time of writing (November 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated in a long time and does not support many recent models. <!-- README_GGUF.md-about-gguf end --> <!-- repositories-available start --> ## Repositories available * AWQ model(s) for GPU inference. * GPTQ models for GPU inference, with multiple quantisation parameter options. * 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGUF models for CPU+GPU inference * Mistral AI_'s original unquantised fp16 model in pytorch format, for GPU inference and for further conversions <!-- repositories-available end --> <!-- prompt-template start --> ## Prompt template: Mistral <!-- prompt-template end --> <!-- compatibility_gguf start --> ## Compatibility These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit d0cee0d They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README. ## Explanation of quantisation methods <details> <summary>Click to see details</summary> The new methods available are: * GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - \"type-1\" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw) * GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - \"type-0\" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw. * GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - \"type-1\" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw. * GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - \"type-1\" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw * GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - \"type-0\" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw Refer to the Provided Files table below to see what files use which methods, and how. </details> <!-- compatibility_gguf end --> <!-- README_GGUF.md-provided-files start --> ## Provided files | Name | Quant method | Bits | Size | Max RAM required | Use case | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q2_K.gguf | Q2_K | 2 | 3.08 GB| 5.58 GB | smallest, significant quality loss - not recommended for most purposes | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q3_K_S.gguf | Q3_K_S | 3 | 3.16 GB| 5.66 GB | very small, high quality loss | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q3_K_M.gguf | Q3_K_M | 3 | 3.52 GB| 6.02 GB | very small, high quality loss | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q3_K_L.gguf | Q3_K_L | 3 | 3.82 GB| 6.32 GB | small, substantial quality loss | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf | Q4_0 | 4 | 4.11 GB| 6.61 GB | legacy; small, very high quality loss - prefer using Q3_K_M | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_S.gguf | Q4_K_S | 4 | 4.14 GB| 6.64 GB | small, greater quality loss | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf | Q4_K_M | 4 | 4.37 GB| 6.87 GB | medium, balanced quality - recommended | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_0.gguf | Q5_0 | 5 | 5.00 GB| 7.50 GB | legacy; medium, balanced quality - prefer using Q4_K_M | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_S.gguf | Q5_K_S | 5 | 5.00 GB| 7.50 GB | large, low quality loss - recommended | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf | Q5_K_M | 5 | 5.13 GB| 7.63 GB | large, very low quality loss - recommended | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q6_K.gguf | Q6_K | 6 | 5.94 GB| 8.44 GB | very large, extremely low quality loss | | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q8_0.gguf | Q8_0 | 8 | 7.70 GB| 10.20 GB | very large, extremely low quality loss - not recommended | **Note**: the above RAM figures assume no GPU offloading.

Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file. The following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from: * LM Studio * LoLLMS Web UI * Faraday.dev ### In Under Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf. Then click Download. ### On the command line, including multiple files at once I recommend using the Python library: Then you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this: <details> <summary>More advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)</summary> You can also download multiple files at once with a pattern: For more documentation on downloading with , please see: HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI. To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install : And set environment variable to : Windows Command Line users: You can set the environment variable by running before the download command. </details> <!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-download end --> <!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-run start --> ## Example command Make sure you are using from commit d0cee0d or later. Change to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration. Change to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value. If you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the argument with For other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation ## How to run in Further instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‚Äê Model Tab.md. ## How to run from Python code You can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python or ctransformers libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models. Therefore I recommend you use llama-cpp-python. ### How to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python For full documentation, please see: llama-cpp-python docs. #### First install the package Run one of the following commands, according to your system: #### Simple llama-cpp-python example code ## How to use with LangChain Here are guides on using llama-cpp-python and ctransformers with LangChain: * LangChain + llama-cpp-python * LangChain + ctransformers <!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-run end --> <!-- footer start --> <!-- 200823 --> ## Discord For further support, and discussions on these models and AI in general, join us at: TheBloke AI's Discord server ## Thanks, and how to contribute Thanks to the chirper.ai team!

For full details of this model please read our paper and release blog post. ## Instruction format In order to leverage instruction fine-tuning, your prompt should be surrounded by and tokens. The very first instruction should begin with a begin of sentence id. The next instructions should not. The assistant generation will be ended by the end-of-sentence token id. E.g. This format is available as a chat template via the method: ## Model Architecture This instruction model is based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, a transformer model with the following architecture choices: - Grouped-Query Attention - Sliding-Window Attention - Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer ## Troubleshooting - If you see the following error: Installing transformers from source should solve the issue pip install git+ This should not be required after transformers-v4.33.4. ## Limitations The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs. ## The Mistral AI Team Albert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, L√©lio Renard Lavaud, Louis Ternon, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Th√©ophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timoth√©e Lacroix, William El Sayed. <!-- original-model-card end -->",
