    "description": "--- license: apache-2.0 license_link: language: - en pipeline_tag: text-generation library_name: transformers --- # Qwen2.5-7B ## Introduction Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models. For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2: - Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains. - Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots. - **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens. - **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. **This repo contains the base 7B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features: - Type: Causal Language Models - Training Stage: Pretraining - Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias - Number of Parameters: 7.61B - Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B - Number of Layers: 28 - Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV - Context Length: 131,072 tokens **We do not recommend using base language models for conversations.** Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., on this model. For more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation. ## Requirements The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face and we advise you to use the latest version of . With , you will encounter the following error: ## Evaluation & Performance Detailed evaluation results are reported in this ðŸ“‘ blog. For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results here. ## Citation If you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.",
    "model_explanation_gemini": "Qwen2.5-7B is a 7.61B-parameter causal language model optimized for text generation, featuring enhanced coding, mathematics, multilingual support (29+ languages), long-context handling (128K tokens), structured data understanding, and improved instruction following, though not recommended for direct conversational use without fine-tuning."
