In comparison with the previous released Qwen, the improvements include: * 8 model sizes, including 0.5B, 1.8B, 4B, 7B, 14B, 32B and 72B dense models, and an MoE model of 14B with 2.7B activated; * Significant performance improvement in human preference for chat models; * Multilingual support of both base and chat models; * Stable support of 32K context length for models of all sizes * No need of . For more details, please refer to our blog post and GitHub repo. In this repo, we provide quantized models in the GGUF formats, including , , , , , , and . To demonstrate their model quality, we follow []( to evaluate their perplexity on wiki test set. Results are shown below: |Size | fp16 | q8_0 | q6_k | q5_k_m | q5_0 | q4_k_m | q4_0 | q3_k_m | q2_k | |--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------| |0.5B | 34.20 | 34.22 | 34.31 | 33.80 | 34.02 | 34.27 | 36.74 | 38.25 | 62.14 | |1.8B | 15.99 | 15.99 | 15.99 | 16.09 | 16.01 | 16.22 | 16.54 | 17.03 | 19.99 | |4B | 13.20 | 13.21 | 13.28 | 13.24 | 13.27 | 13.61 | 13.44 | 13.67 | 15.65 | |7B | 14.21 | 14.24 | 14.35 | 14.32 | 14.12 | 14.35 | 14.47 | 15.11 | 16.57 | |14B | 10.91 | 10.91 | 10.93 | 10.98 | 10.88 | 10.92 | 10.92 | 11.24 | 12.27 | |32B | 8.87 | 8.89 | 8.91 | 8.94 | 8.93 | 8.96 | 9.17 | 9.14 | 10.51 | |72B | 7.97 | 7.99 | 7.99 | 7.99 | 8.01 | 8.00 | 8.01 | 8.06 | 8.63 | ## Model Details Qwen1.5 is a language model series including decoder language models of different model sizes. For each size, we release the base language model and the aligned chat model. It is based on the Transformer architecture with SwiGLU activation, attention QKV bias, group query attention, mixture of sliding window attention and full attention, etc. Additionally, we have an improved tokenizer adaptive to multiple natural languages and codes. For the beta version, temporarily we did not include GQA (except for 32B) and the mixture of SWA and full attention. ## Training details We pretrained the models with a large amount of data, and we post-trained the models with both supervised finetuning and direct preference optimization. ## Requirements We advise you to clone []( and install it following the official guide. ## How to use Cloning the repo may be inefficient, and thus you can manually download the GGUF file that you need or use () as shown below: We demonstrate how to use to run Qwen1.5: ## Citation If you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.",
