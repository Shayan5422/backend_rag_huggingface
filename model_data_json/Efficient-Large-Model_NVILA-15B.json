Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This \"scale-then-compress\" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility. **Model date:** NVILA was trained in Nov 2024. **Paper or resources for more information:** ## License - The code is released under the Apache 2.0 license as found in the LICENSE file. - The pretrained weights are released under the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license. - The service is a research preview intended for non-commercial use only, and is subject to the following licenses and terms: - Terms of Use of the data generated by OpenAI - Dataset Licenses for each one used during training. **Where to send questions or comments about the model:** ## Intended use **Primary intended uses:** The primary use of VILA is research on large multimodal models and chatbots. **Primary intended users:** The primary intended users of the model are researchers and hobbyists in computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. ## Input: **Input Type:** Image, Video, Text **Input Format:** Red, Green, Blue; MP4 ;String **Input Parameters:** 2D, 3D ## Output: **Output Type:** Text **Output Format:** String **Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:** * Ampere * Jetson * Hopper * Lovelace **[Preferred/Supported] Operating System(s):** <br> Linux ## Training dataset See Dataset Preparation for more details. ** Data Collection Method by dataset * [Hybrid: Automated, Human] ** Labeling Method by dataset * [Hybrid: Automated, Human] ## Inference: **Engine:** [Tensor(RT), Triton, Or List Other Here] * PyTorch * TensorRT-LLM * TinyChat **Test Hardware:** * A100 * Jetson Orin * RTX 4090 ## Ethical Considerations NVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications.
