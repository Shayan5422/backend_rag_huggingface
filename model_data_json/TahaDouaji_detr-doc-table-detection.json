(2021) and Bender et al. (2021)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. ## Recommendations Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations. # Training Details ## Training Data The model was trained on ICDAR2019 Table Dataset # Environmental Impact Carbon emissions can be estimated using the Machine Learning Impact calculator presented in Lacoste et al. (2019). # Citation **BibTeX:** # Model Card Authors [optional] Taha Douaji in collaboration with Ezi Ozoani and the Hugging Face team # Model Card Contact More information needed # How to Get Started with the Model Use the code below to get started with the model.",
