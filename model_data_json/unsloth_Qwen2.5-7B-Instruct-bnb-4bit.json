We have a Qwen 2.5 (all model sizes) free Google Colab Tesla T4 notebook. Also a Qwen 2.5 conversational style notebook. <img src=\" width=\"200\"/> <img src=\" width=\"200\"/> ## ‚ú® Finetune for Free All notebooks are **beginner friendly**! Add your dataset, click \"Run All\", and you'll get a 2x faster finetuned model which can be exported to GGUF, vLLM or uploaded to Hugging Face. | Unsloth supports | Free Notebooks | Performance | Memory use | |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------| | **Llama-3.2 (3B)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2.4x faster | 58% less | | **Llama-3.2 (11B vision)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2x faster | 60% less | | **Llama-3.1 (8B)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2.4x faster | 58% less | | **Qwen2 VL (7B)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 1.8x faster | 60% less | | **Qwen2.5 (7B)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2x faster | 60% less | | **Phi-3.5 (mini)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2x faster | 50% less | | **Gemma 2 (9B)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2.4x faster | 58% less | | **Mistral (7B)** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 2.2x faster | 62% less | | **DPO - Zephyr** | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start on Colab | 1.9x faster | 19% less | <img src=\" width=\"200\"/> - This conversational notebook is useful for ShareGPT ChatML / Vicuna templates. - This text completion notebook is for raw text. This DPO notebook replicates Zephyr. - \\* Kaggle has 2x T4s, but we use 1. Due to overhead, 1x T4 is 5x faster. # Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct ## Introduction Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models. For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2: - Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains. - Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots. - **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens. - **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. **This repo contains the instruction-tuned 7B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features: - Type: Causal Language Models - Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training - Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias - Number of Parameters: 7.61B - Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B - Number of Layers: 28 - Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV - Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens and generation 8192 tokens - Please refer to this section for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts. For more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation. ## Requirements The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face and we advise you to use the latest version of . With , you will encounter the following error: ## Quickstart Here provides a code snippet with to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents. ### Processing Long Texts The current is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens. To handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize YaRN, a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts. For supported frameworks, you could add the following to to enable YaRN: For deployment, we recommend using vLLM. Please refer to our Documentation for usage if you are not familar with vLLM. Presently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. We advise adding the configuration only when processing long contexts is required. ## Evaluation & Performance Detailed evaluation results are reported in this üìë blog. For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results here. ## Citation If you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.",
