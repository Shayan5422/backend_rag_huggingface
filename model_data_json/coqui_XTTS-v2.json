There is no need for an excessive amount of training data that spans countless hours. This is the same or similar model to what powers Coqui Studio and Coqui API. ### Features - Supports 17 languages. - Voice cloning with just a 6-second audio clip. - Emotion and style transfer by cloning. - Cross-language voice cloning. - Multi-lingual speech generation. - 24khz sampling rate. ### Updates over XTTS-v1 - 2 new languages; Hungarian and Korean - Architectural improvements for speaker conditioning. - Enables the use of multiple speaker references and interpolation between speakers. - Stability improvements. - Better prosody and audio quality across the board. ### Languages XTTS-v2 supports 17 languages: **English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt), Polish (pl), Turkish (tr), Russian (ru), Dutch (nl), Czech (cs), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh-cn), Japanese (ja), Hungarian (hu), Korean (ko) Hindi (hi)**. Stay tuned as we continue to add support for more languages. If you have any language requests, feel free to reach out! ### Code The code-base supports inference and fine-tuning. ### Demo Spaces - XTTS Space : You can see how model performs on supported languages, and try with your own reference or microphone input - XTTS Voice Chat with Mistral or Zephyr : You can experience streaming voice chat with Mistral 7B Instruct or Zephyr 7B Beta | | | | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | | 🐸💬 **CoquiTTS** | coqui/TTS on Github| | 💼 **Documentation** | ReadTheDocs | 👩‍💻 **Questions** | GitHub Discussions | | 🗯 **Community** | Discord | ### License This model is licensed under Coqui Public Model License.
