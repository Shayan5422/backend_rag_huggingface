    "description": "--- tags: - text-classification - bert --- # Model Card for bleurt-tiny-512 # Model Details ## Model Description Pytorch version of the original BLEURT models from ACL paper - **Developed by:** Elron Bandel, Thibault Sellam, Dipanjan Das and Ankur P. Parikh of Google Research - **Shared by [Optional]:** Elron Bandel - **Model type:** Text Classification - **Language(s) (NLP):** More information needed - **License:** More information needed - **Parent Model:** BERT - **Resources for more information:** - GitHub Repo - Associated Paper - Blog Post # Uses ## Direct Use This model can be used for the task of Text Classification ## Downstream Use [Optional] More information needed. ## Out-of-Scope Use The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. # Bias, Risks, and Limitations Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., Sheng et al. (2021) and Bender et al. (2021)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. ## Recommendations Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations. # Training Details ## Training Data The model authors note in the associated paper: > We use years 2017 to 2019 of the WMT Metrics Shared Task, to-English language pairs. For each year, we used the of- ficial WMT test set, which include several thou- sand pairs of sentences with human ratings from the news domain. The training sets contain 5,360, 9,492, and 147,691 records for each year. ## Training Procedure ### Preprocessing More information needed ### Speeds, Sizes, Times More information needed # Evaluation ## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics ### Testing Data The test sets for years 2018 and 2019 [of the WMT Metrics Shared Task, to-English language pairs.] are noisier, ### Factors More information needed ### Metrics More information needed ## Results More information needed # Model Examination More information needed # Environmental Impact Carbon emissions can be estimated using the Machine Learning Impact calculator presented in Lacoste et al. (2019). - **Hardware Type:** More information needed - **Hours used:** More information needed - **Cloud Provider:** More information needed - **Compute Region:** More information needed - **Carbon Emitted:** More information needed # Technical Specifications [optional] ## Model Architecture and Objective More information needed ## Compute Infrastructure More information needed ### Hardware More information needed ### Software More information needed. # Citation **BibTeX:** # Glossary [optional] More information needed # More Information [optional] More information needed # Model Card Authors [optional] Elron Bandel in collaboration with Ezi Ozoani and the Hugging Face team # Model Card Contact More information needed # How to Get Started with the Model Use the code below to get started with the model. <details> <summary> Click to expand </summary> See this notebook for model conversion code. </details>",
