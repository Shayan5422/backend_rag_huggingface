However, this scaling approach introduces significant deployment challenges, including increased inference latency and memory usage. These challenges are particularly severe in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, where large models' increased memory requirements constrain dataset ingestion capacity, and their higher latency directly impacts query-time performance. While causal language models have addressed similar efficiency challenges using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, this approach hasn't been successfully adapted to the general text embedding setting. In this paper, we introduce Nomic Embed v2, the first general purpose MoE text embedding model. Our model outperforms models in the same parameter class on both monolingual and multilingual benchmarks while also maintaining competitive performance with models twice its size. We open-source all code, models, and evaluation data to ensure full reproducibility of our training pipeline at ## Usage Guide ### Installation The model can be used through SentenceTransformers and Transformers. For best performance on GPU, please install > [!IMPORTANT] > **Important!** > The text prompt *must* include a *task instruction prefix*, instructing the model which task is being performed. Please use before your queries/questions, and before your documents. ### Transformers If using Transformers, **make sure to prepend the task instruction prefix**. For truncation, you can trucate before applying normalization ### SentenceTransformers With SentenceTransformers, you can specify the as either or , and the task instruction will be included automatically. For truncation/Matryoshka embeddings, you can specify and use the model similarly ## Performance nomic-embed-text-v2-moe performance on BEIR and MIRACL compared to other open-weights embedding models: !image/png nomic-embed-text-v2-moe performance on BEIR at 768 dimension and truncated to 256 dimensions: !image/png ## Best Practices - Add appropriate prefixes to your text: - For queries: \"search_query: \" - For documents: \"search_document: \" - Maximum input length is 512 tokens - For optimal efficiency, consider using the 256-dimension embeddings if storage/compute is a concern ## Limitations - Performance may vary across different languages - Resource requirements may be higher than traditional dense models due to MoE architecture - Must use when loading the model to use our custom architecture implementation ## Training Details !image/png - Trained on 1.6 billion high-quality pairs across multiple languages - Uses consistency filtering to ensure high-quality training data - Incorporates Matryoshka representation learning for dimension flexibility - Training includes both weakly-supervised contrastive pretraining and supervised finetuning For more details, please check out the blog post and technical report. ## Join the Nomic Community - Nomic: - Discord: - Twitter: # Citation If you find the model, dataset, or training code useful, please cite our work",
