Thanks! <a href=\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" ></a> ## Model description **bert-base-NER** is a fine-tuned BERT model that is ready to use for **Named Entity Recognition** and achieves **state-of-the-art performance** for the NER task. It has been trained to recognize four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC). Specifically, this model is a *bert-base-cased* model that was fine-tuned on the English version of the standard CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition dataset. If you'd like to use a larger BERT-large model fine-tuned on the same dataset, a **bert-large-NER** version is also available. ### Available NER models | Model Name | Description | Parameters | |-------------------|-------------|------------------| | distilbert-NER **(NEW!)** | Fine-tuned DistilBERT - a smaller, faster, lighter version of BERT | 66M | | bert-large-NER | Fine-tuned bert-large-cased - larger model with slightly better performance | 340M | | bert-base-NER-(uncased) | Fine-tuned bert-base, available in both cased and uncased versions | 110M | ## Intended uses & limitations #### How to use You can use this model with Transformers *pipeline* for NER. #### Limitations and bias This model is limited by its training dataset of entity-annotated news articles from a specific span of time. This may not generalize well for all use cases in different domains. Furthermore, the model occassionally tags subword tokens as entities and post-processing of results may be necessary to handle those cases. ## Training data This model was fine-tuned on English version of the standard CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition dataset. The training dataset distinguishes between the beginning and continuation of an entity so that if there are back-to-back entities of the same type, the model can output where the second entity begins. As in the dataset, each token will be classified as one of the following classes: Abbreviation|Description -|- O|Outside of a named entity B-MISC |Beginning of a miscellaneous entity right after another miscellaneous entity I-MISC | Miscellaneous entity B-PER |Beginning of a person’s name right after another person’s name I-PER |Person’s name B-ORG |Beginning of an organization right after another organization I-ORG |organization B-LOC |Beginning of a location right after another location I-LOC |Location ### CoNLL-2003 English Dataset Statistics This dataset was derived from the Reuters corpus which consists of Reuters news stories. You can read more about how this dataset was created in the CoNLL-2003 paper. #### # of training examples per entity type Dataset|LOC|MISC|ORG|PER -|-|-|-|- Train|7140|3438|6321|6600 Dev|1837|922|1341|1842 Test|1668|702|1661|1617 #### # of articles/sentences/tokens per dataset Dataset |Articles |Sentences |Tokens -|-|-|- Train |946 |14,987 |203,621 Dev |216 |3,466 |51,362 Test |231 |3,684 |46,435 ## Training procedure This model was trained on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU with recommended hyperparameters from the original BERT paper which trained & evaluated the model on CoNLL-2003 NER task. ## Eval results metric|dev|test -|-|- f1 |95.1 |91.3 precision |95.0 |90.7 recall |95.3 |91.9 The test metrics are a little lower than the official Google BERT results which encoded document context & experimented with CRF.
