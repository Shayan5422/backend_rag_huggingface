    "description": "--- language: en thumbnail: license: apache-2.0 --- ## ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators **ELECTRA** is a new method for self-supervised language representation learning. It can be used to pre-train transformer networks using relatively little compute. ELECTRA models are trained to distinguish \"real\" input tokens vs \"fake\" input tokens generated by another neural network, similar to the discriminator of a GAN. At small scale, ELECTRA achieves strong results even when trained on a single GPU. At large scale, ELECTRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. For a detailed description and experimental results, please refer to our paper ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators. This repository contains code to pre-train ELECTRA, including small ELECTRA models on a single GPU. It also supports fine-tuning ELECTRA on downstream tasks including classification tasks (e.g,. GLUE), QA tasks (e.g., SQuAD), and sequence tagging tasks (e.g., text chunking). ## How to use the discriminator in",
