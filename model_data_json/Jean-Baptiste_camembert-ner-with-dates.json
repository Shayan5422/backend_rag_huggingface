Model was trained on enriched version of wikiner-fr dataset (~170 634 sentences). On my test data (mix of chat and email), this model got an f1 score of ~83% (in comparison dateparser was ~70%). Dateparser library can still be be used on the output of this model in order to convert text to python datetime object ( ## How to use camembert-ner-with-dates with HuggingFace ##### Load camembert-ner-with-dates and its sub-word tokenizer : ## Model performances (metric: seqeval) Global By entity",
