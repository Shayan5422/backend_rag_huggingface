This checkpoint corresponds to the ControlNet conditioned on **Canny edges**. It can be used in combination with Stable Diffusion. !img ## Model Details - **Developed by:** Lvmin Zhang, Maneesh Agrawala - **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation model - **Language(s):** English - **License:** The CreativeML OpenRAIL M license is an Open RAIL M license, adapted from the work that BigScience and the RAIL Initiative are jointly carrying in the area of responsible AI licensing.

The abstract reads as follows: *We present a neural network structure, ControlNet, to control pretrained large diffusion models to support additional input conditions. The ControlNet learns task-specific conditions in an end-to-end way, and the learning is robust even when the training dataset is small (< 50k). Moreover, training a ControlNet is as fast as fine-tuning a diffusion model, and the model can be trained on a personal devices. Alternatively, if powerful computation clusters are available, the model can scale to large amounts (millions to billions) of data. We report that large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be augmented with ControlNets to enable conditional inputs like edge maps, segmentation maps, keypoints, etc. This may enrich the methods to control large diffusion models and further facilitate related applications.* ## Released Checkpoints The authors released 8 different checkpoints, each trained with Stable Diffusion v1-5 on a different type of conditioning: | Model Name | Control Image Overview| Control Image Example | Generated Image Example | |---|---|---|---| |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny<br/> *Trained with canny edge detection* | A monochrome image with white edges on a black background.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-depth<br/> *Trained with Midas depth estimation* |A grayscale image with black representing deep areas and white representing shallow areas.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-hed<br/> *Trained with HED edge detection (soft edge)* |A monochrome image with white soft edges on a black background.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" | |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-mlsd<br/> *Trained with M-LSD line detection* |A monochrome image composed only of white straight lines on a black background.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-normal<br/> *Trained with normal map* |A normal mapped image.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet_openpose<br/> *Trained with OpenPose bone image* |A OpenPose bone image.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet_scribble<br/> *Trained with human scribbles* |A hand-drawn monochrome image with white outlines on a black background.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" | |lllyasviel/sd-controlnet_seg<br/>*Trained with semantic segmentation* |An ADE20K's segmentation protocol image.|<a href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" href=\" width=\"64\" src=\" | ## Example It is recommended to use the checkpoint with Stable Diffusion v1-5 as the checkpoint has been trained on it. Experimentally, the checkpoint can be used with other diffusion models such as dreamboothed stable diffusion. **Note**: If you want to process an image to create the auxiliary conditioning, external dependencies are required as shown below: 1. Install opencv 2. Let's install and related packages: 3. Run code: !bird !bird_canny !bird_canny_out ### Training The canny edge model was trained on 3M edge-image, caption pairs. The model was trained for 600 GPU-hours with Nvidia A100 80G using Stable Diffusion 1.5 as a base model. ### Blog post For more information, please also have a look at the official ControlNet Blog Post.",
