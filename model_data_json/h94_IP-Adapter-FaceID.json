IP-Adapter-FaceID can generate various style images conditioned on a face with only text prompts. !results **Update 2023/12/27**: IP-Adapter-FaceID-Plus: face ID embedding (for face ID) + CLIP image embedding (for face structure) <div align=\"center\"> !results </div> **Update 2023/12/28**: IP-Adapter-FaceID-PlusV2: face ID embedding (for face ID) + controllable CLIP image embedding (for face structure) You can adjust the weight of the face structure to get different generation! <div align=\"center\"> !results </div> **Update 2024/01/04**: IP-Adapter-FaceID-SDXL: An experimental SDXL version of IP-Adapter-FaceID <div align=\"center\"> !results </div> **Update 2024/01/17**: IP-Adapter-FaceID-PlusV2-SDXL: An experimental SDXL version of IP-Adapter-FaceID-PlusV2 **Update 2024/01/19**: IP-Adapter-FaceID-Portrait: same with IP-Adapter-FaceID but for portrait generation (no lora! no controlnet!). Specifically, it accepts multiple facial images to enhance similarity (the default is 5). <div align=\"center\"> !results </div> ## Usage ### IP-Adapter-FaceID Firstly, you should use insightface to extract face ID embedding: Then, you can generate images conditioned on the face embeddings: you can also use a normal IP-Adapter and a normal LoRA to load model: ### IP-Adapter-FaceID-SDXL Firstly, you should use insightface to extract face ID embedding: Then, you can generate images conditioned on the face embeddings: ### IP-Adapter-FaceID-Plus Firstly, you should use insightface to extract face ID embedding and face image: Then, you can generate images conditioned on the face embeddings: ### IP-Adapter-FaceID-Portrait ## Limitations and Bias - The models do not achieve perfect photorealism and ID consistency. - The generalization of the models is limited due to limitations of the training data, base model and face recognition model. ## Non-commercial use **AS InsightFace pretrained models are available for non-commercial research purposes, IP-Adapter-FaceID models are released exclusively for research purposes and is not intended for commercial use.**",
