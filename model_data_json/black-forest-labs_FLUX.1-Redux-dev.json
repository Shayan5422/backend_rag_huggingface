Given an input image, FLUX.1 Redux can reproduce the image with slight variation, allowing to refine a given image. It naturally integrates into more complex workflows unlocking image restyling. Restyling via text is also available through our API by providing an image plus a language prompt. For more information, please read our blog post. # Usage We provide a reference implementation of , as well as sampling code, in a dedicated github repository. ## API Endpoints is available in our API bfl.ml. In addition to the adapter, the API endpoint allows users to modify an image given a textual description. The feature is supported in our latest model FLUX1.1 [pro] Ultra, allowing for combining input images and text prompts to create high-quality 4-megapixel outputs with flexible aspect ratios. !image/png ## Diffusers To use with the ðŸ§¨ diffusers python library, first install or upgrade diffusers Then you can use along with to generate images from images.
