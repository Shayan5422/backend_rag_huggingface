When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz. This model has been fine-tuned by the HuggingSound tool, and thanks to the GPU credits generously given by the OVHcloud :) ## Usage Using the HuggingSound library: Writing your own inference script: ## Evaluation Commands 1. To evaluate on with split 2. To evaluate on ## Citation If you want to cite this model you can use this:",
