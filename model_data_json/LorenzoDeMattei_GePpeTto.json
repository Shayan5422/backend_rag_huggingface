    "description": "--- language: it --- # GePpeTto GPT2 Model ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Pretrained GPT2 117M model for Italian. You can find further details in the paper: Lorenzo De Mattei, Michele Cafagna, Felice Dellâ€™Orletta, Malvina Nissim, Marco Guerini \"GePpeTto Carves Italian into a Language Model\", arXiv preprint. Pdf available at: ## Pretraining Corpus The pretraining set comprises two main sources. The first one is a dump of Italian Wikipedia (November 2019), consisting of 2.8GB of text. The second one is the ItWac corpus (Baroni et al., 2009), which amounts to 11GB of web texts. This collection provides a mix of standard and less standard Italian, on a rather wide chronological span, with older texts than the Wikipedia dump (the latter stretches only to the late 2000s). ## Pretraining details This model was trained using GPT2's Hugging Face implemenation on 4 NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU for 620k steps. Training parameters: - GPT-2 small configuration - vocabulary size: 30k - Batch size: 32 - Block size: 100 - Adam Optimizer - Initial learning rate: 5e-5 - Warm up steps: 10k ## Perplexity scores | Domain | Perplexity | |---|---| | Wikipedia | 26.1052 | | ItWac | 30.3965 | | Legal | 37.2197 | | News | 45.3859 | | Social Media | 84.6408 | For further details, qualitative analysis and human evaluation check out: ## Load Pretrained Model You can use this model by installing Huggingface library . And you can use it directly by initializing it like this: ## Example using GPT2LMHeadModel Output is, ## Citation Please use the following bibtex entry: ## References Marco Baroni, Silvia Bernardini, Adriano Ferraresi, and Eros Zanchetta. 2009.
