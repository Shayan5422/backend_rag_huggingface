A. Filiot et al., medRxiv 2023.07.21.23292757; doi: - **Pretrain Dataset:** 40 million pan-cancer tiles extracted from TGCA - **Original:** - **License:** Owkin non-commercial license ## Uses ### Direct Use The primary use of the Phikon model can be used for feature extraction from histology image tiles. ### Downstream Use The model can be used for cancer classification on a variety of cancer subtypes. The model can also be finetuned to specialise on cancer subtypes. ## Technical Specifications ### Compute Infrastructure All the models we built were trained on the French Jean Zay cluster. ### Hardware NVIDIA V100 GPUs with 32Gb RAM ### Software PyTorch 1.13.1 --- ### BibTeX entry and citation info",
