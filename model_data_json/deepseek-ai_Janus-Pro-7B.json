Introduction Janus-Pro is a novel autoregressive framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation. It addresses the limitations of previous approaches by decoupling visual encoding into separate pathways, while still utilizing a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder’s roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework’s flexibility. Janus-Pro surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus-Pro make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models. **Github Repository** <div align=\"center\"> <img alt=\"image\" src=\"janus_pro_teaser1.png\" style=\"width:90%;\"> </div> <div align=\"center\"> <img alt=\"image\" src=\"janus_pro_teaser2.png\" style=\"width:90%;\"> </div> ### 2. Model Summary Janus-Pro is a unified understanding and generation MLLM, which decouples visual encoding for multimodal understanding and generation. Janus-Pro is constructed based on the DeepSeek-LLM-1.5b-base/DeepSeek-LLM-7b-base. For multimodal understanding, it uses the SigLIP-L as the vision encoder, which supports 384 x 384 image input. For image generation, Janus-Pro uses the tokenizer from here with a downsample rate of 16. ## 3. Quick Start Please refer to **Github Repository** ## 4.
