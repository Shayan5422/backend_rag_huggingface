The model has 278M parameters and is available in 23 Indic languages and English. The models are trained with various objectives and datasets. The list of models are as follows: - IndicBERT-MLM [Model] - A vanilla BERT style model trained on IndicCorp v2 with the MLM objective - +Samanantar [Model] - TLM as an additional objective with Samanantar Parallel Corpus [Paper] | [Dataset] - +Back-Translation [Model] - TLM as an additional objective by translating the Indic parts of IndicCorp v2 dataset into English w/ IndicTrans model [Model] - IndicBERT-SS [Model] - To encourage better lexical sharing among languages we convert the scripts from Indic languages to Devanagari and train a BERT style model with the MLM objective ## Run Fine-tuning Fine-tuning scripts are based on transformers library. Create a new conda environment and set it up as follows: All the tasks follow the same structure, please check individual files for detailed hyper-parameter choices. The following command runs the fine-tuning for a task: Arguments: - MODEL_NAME: name of the model to fine-tune, can be a local path or a model from the HuggingFace Model Hub - TASK_NAME: one of [] > For MASSIVE task, please use the instrction provided in the official repository ## Citation",
