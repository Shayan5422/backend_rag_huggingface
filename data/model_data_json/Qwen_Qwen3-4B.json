    "description": "--- library_name: transformers license: apache-2.0 license_link: pipeline_tag: text-generation base_model: - Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base --- # Qwen3-4B <a href=\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"margin: 2px;\"> <img alt=\"Chat\" src=\" style=\"display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;\"/> </a> ## Qwen3 Highlights Qwen3 is the latest generation of large language models in Qwen series, offering a comprehensive suite of dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features: - **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios. - **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning. - **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience. - **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks. - **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**. ## Model Overview **Qwen3-4B** has the following features: - Type: Causal Language Models - Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training - Number of Parameters: 4.0B - Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 3.6B - Number of Layers: 36 - Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 8 for KV - Context Length: 32,768 natively and 131,072 tokens with YaRN.

It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed. ### Citation If you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite."
