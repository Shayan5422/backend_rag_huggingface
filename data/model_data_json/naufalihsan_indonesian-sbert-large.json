    "description": "--- pipeline_tag: sentence-similarity tags: - sentence-transformers - feature-extraction - sentence-similarity - transformers --- # {MODEL_NAME} This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 1024 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search. <!--- Describe your model here --> ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) Using this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed: Then you can use the model like this: ## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers) Without sentence-transformers, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings. ## Evaluation Results <!--- Describe how your model was evaluated --> For an automated evaluation of this model, see the *Sentence Embeddings Benchmark*: ## Training The model was trained with the parameters: **DataLoader**: of length 360 with parameters: **Loss**: Parameters of the fit()-Method: ## Full Model Architecture ## Citing & Authors <!--- Describe where people can find more information -->"
