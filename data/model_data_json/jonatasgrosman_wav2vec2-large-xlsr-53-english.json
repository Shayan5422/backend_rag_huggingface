When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz. This model has been fine-tuned thanks to the GPU credits generously given by the OVHcloud :) The script used for training can be found here: ## Usage The model can be used directly (without a language model) as follows... Using the HuggingSound library: Writing your own inference script: | Reference | Prediction | | ------------- | ------------- | | \"SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.\" | SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT | | SIX | SIX | | \"ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.\" | ALL AS WELL THAT ENDS WELL | | DO YOU MEAN IT? | DO YOU MEAN IT | | THE NEW PATCH IS LESS INVASIVE THAN THE OLD ONE, BUT STILL CAUSES REGRESSIONS. | THE NEW PATCH IS LESS INVASIVE THAN THE OLD ONE BUT STILL CAUSES REGRESSION | | HOW IS MOZILLA GOING TO HANDLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE QUEUE AND CUE? | HOW IS MOSLILLAR GOING TO HANDLE ANDBEWOOTH HIS LIKE Q AND Q | | \"I GUESS YOU MUST THINK I'M KINDA BATTY.\" | RUSTIAN WASTIN PAN ONTE BATTLY | | NO ONE NEAR THE REMOTE MACHINE YOU COULD RING? | NO ONE NEAR THE REMOTE MACHINE YOU COULD RING | | SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE IS SAUCE FOR THE GANDER. | SAUCE FOR THE GUICE IS SAUCE FOR THE GONDER | | GROVES STARTED WRITING SONGS WHEN SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. | GRAFS STARTED WRITING SONGS WHEN SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD | ## Evaluation 1.
