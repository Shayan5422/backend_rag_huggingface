You also can download the model in python script: For face encoder, you need to manutally download via this URL to . Then, you can customized your own face images For more details, please follow the instructions in our GitHub repository. ## Usage Tips 1. If you're not satisfied with the similarity, try to increase the weight of \"IdentityNet Strength\" and \"Adapter Strength\". 2. If you feel that the saturation is too high, first decrease the Adapter strength. If it is still too high, then decrease the IdentityNet strength. 3. If you find that text control is not as expected, decrease Adapter strength. 4. If you find that realistic style is not good enough, go for our Github repo and use a more realistic base model. ## Demos <div align=\"center\"> <img src='examples/0.png'> </div> <div align=\"center\"> <img src='examples/1.png'> </div> ## Disclaimer This project is released under Apache License and aims to positively impact the field of AI-driven image generation.
