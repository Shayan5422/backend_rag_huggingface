    "description": "--- license: other license_name: public-domain license_link: LICENSE --- # MedCPT Introduction **MedCPT generates embeddings of biomedical texts that can be used for semantic search (dense retrieval)**. The model contains two encoders: - MedCPT Query Encoder: compute the embeddings of short texts (e.g., questions, search queries, sentences). - MedCPT Article Encoder: compute the embeddings of articles (e.g., PubMed titles & abstracts). **This repo contains the MedCPT Query Encoder.** **MedCPT has been pre-trained by an unprecedented scale of 255M query-article pairs from PubMed search logs**, and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several zero-shot biomedical IR datasets. In general, there are three use cases: 1. Query-to-article search with both encoders. 2. Query representation for clustering or query-to-query search with the query encoder. 3. Article representation for clustering or article-to-article search with the article encoder. For more details, please check out our paper (Bioinformatics, 2023). Please note that the released version is slightly different from the version reported in the paper. # Case 1. Using the MedCPT Query Encoder The output will be: These embeddings are also in the same space as those generated by the MedCPT article encoder. # Case 2. Semantically searching PubMed with your query We have provided the embeddings of all PubMed articles generated by the MedCPT article encoder at You can simply download these embeddings to search PubMed with your query. # Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine. # Disclaimer This tool shows the results of research conducted in the Computational Biology Branch, NCBI/NLM.
