    "description": "--- language: fa license: apache-2.0 --- # ParsBERT (v2.0) A Transformer-based Model for Persian Language Understanding We reconstructed the vocabulary and fine-tuned the ParsBERT v1.1 on the new Persian corpora in order to provide some functionalities for using ParsBERT in other scopes! Please follow the ParsBERT repo for the latest information about previous and current models. ## Persian NER [ARMAN, PEYMA] This task aims to extract named entities in the text, such as names and label with appropriate classes such as locations, organizations, etc. The datasets used for this task contain sentences that are marked with format. In this format, tokens that are not part of an entity are tagged as the tag corresponds to the first word of an object, and the tag corresponds to the rest of the terms of the same entity. Both and tags are followed by a hyphen (or underscore), followed by the entity category. Therefore, the NER task is a multi-class token classification problem that labels the tokens upon being fed a raw text. There are two primary datasets used in Persian NER, , and . ### PEYMA PEYMA dataset includes 7,145 sentences with a total of 302,530 tokens from which 41,148 tokens are tagged with seven different classes. 1. Organization 2. Money 3. Location 4. Date 5. Time 6. Person 7.
