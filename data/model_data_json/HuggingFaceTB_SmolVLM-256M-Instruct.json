It accepts arbitrary sequences of image and text inputs to produce text outputs. It's designed for efficiency. SmolVLM can answer questions about images, describe visual content, or transcribe text. Its lightweight architecture makes it suitable for on-device applications while maintaining strong performance on multimodal tasks. It can run inference on one image with under 1GB of GPU RAM. ## Model Summary - **Developed by:** Hugging Face ðŸ¤— - **Model type:** Multi-modal model (image+text) - **Language(s) (NLP):** English - **License:** Apache 2.0 - **Architecture:** Based on Idefics3 (see technical summary) ## Resources - **Demo:** SmolVLM-256 Demo - **Blog:** Blog post ## Uses SmolVLM can be used for inference on multimodal (image + text) tasks where the input comprises text queries along with one or more images. Text and images can be interleaved arbitrarily, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and storytelling based on visual content. The model does not support image generation. To fine-tune SmolVLM on a specific task, you can follow the fine-tuning tutorial. ### Technical Summary SmolVLM leverages the lightweight SmolLM2 language model to provide a compact yet powerful multimodal experience. It introduces several changes compared to the larger SmolVLM 2.2B model: - **Image compression:** We introduce a more radical image compression compared to Idefics3 and SmolVLM-2.2B to enable the model to infer faster and use less RAM. - **Visual Token Encoding:** SmolVLM-256 uses 64 visual tokens to encode image patches of size 512Ã—512. Larger images are divided into patches, each encoded separately, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance. - **New special tokens:** We added new special tokens to divide the subimages. This allows for more efficient tokenization of the images. - **Smoller vision encoder:** We went from a 400M parameter siglip vision encoder to a much smaller 93M encoder. - **Larger image patches:** We are now passing patches of 512x512 to the vision encoder, instead of 384x384 like the larger SmolVLM. This allows the information to be encoded more efficiently. More details about the training and architecture are available in our technical report. ### How to get started You can use transformers to load, infer and fine-tune SmolVLM. We also provide ONNX weights for the model, which you can run with ONNX Runtime as follows: <details> <summary>Click here to see the sample code</summary> Example output: </details> ### Model optimizations **Precision**: For better performance, load and run the model in half-precision () if your hardware supports it. You can also load SmolVLM with 4/8-bit quantization using bitsandbytes, torchao or Quanto. Refer to this page for other options. **Vision Encoder Efficiency**: Adjust the image resolution by setting when initializing the processor, where N is your desired value. The default works well, which results in input images of size 2048Ã—2048. Decreasing N can save GPU memory and is appropriate for lower-resolution images. This is also useful if you want to fine-tune on videos. ## Misuse and Out-of-scope Use SmolVLM is not intended for high-stakes scenarios or critical decision-making processes that affect an individual's well-being or livelihood. The model may produce content that appears factual but may not be accurate. Misuse includes, but is not limited to: - Prohibited Uses: - Evaluating or scoring individuals (e.g., in employment, education, credit) - Critical automated decision-making - Generating unreliable factual content - Malicious Activities: - Spam generation - Disinformation campaigns - Harassment or abuse - Unauthorized surveillance ### License SmolVLM is built upon SigLIP as image encoder and SmolLM2 for text decoder part. We release the SmolVLM checkpoints under the Apache 2.0 license. ## Training Details ### Training Data The training data comes from The Cauldron and Docmatix datasets, with emphasis on document understanding (25%) and image captioning (18%), while maintaining balanced coverage across other crucial capabilities like visual reasoning, chart comprehension, and general instruction following. <img src=\" alt=\"Example Image\" style=\"width:90%;\" /> ## Evaluation | Size | Mathvista | MMMU | OCRBench | MMStar | AI2D | ChartQA_Test | Science_QA | TextVQA Val | DocVQA Val | |-------|-----------|------|----------|--------|-------|--------------|------------|-------------|------------| | 256M | 35.9 | 28.3 | 52.6 | 34.6 | 47 | 55.8 | 73.6 | 49.9 | 58.3 | | 500M | 40.1 | 33.7 | 61 | 38.3 | 59.5 | 63.2 | 79.7 | 60.5 | 70.5 | | 2.2B | 43.9 | 38.3 | 65.5 | 41.8 | 64 | 71.6 | 84.5 | 72.1 | 79.7 | # Citation information You can cite us in the following way:",
