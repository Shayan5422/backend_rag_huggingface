F1-Score: **90,61** (WikiNER) Predicts 4 tags: | **tag** | **meaning** | |---------------------------------|-----------| | PER | person name | | LOC | location name | | ORG | organization name | | MISC | other name | Based on Flair embeddings and LSTM-CRF. --- ### Demo: How to use in Flair Requires: **Flair** () This yields the following output: So, the entities \"*George Washington*\" (labeled as a **person**) and \"*Washington*\" (labeled as a **location**) are found in the sentence \"*George Washington est allé à Washington*\". --- ### Training: Script to train this model The following Flair script was used to train this model: --- ### Cite Please cite the following paper when using this model. --- ### Issues? The Flair issue tracker is available here.",
