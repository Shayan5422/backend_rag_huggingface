Citation ## Model Details !image/png > The YOLO series has become the most popular framework for real-time object detection due to its reasonable trade-off between speed and accuracy. However, we observe that the speed and accuracy of YOLOs are negatively affected by the NMS. Recently, end-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have provided an alternative to eliminating NMS. Nevertheless, the high computational cost limits their practicality and hinders them from fully exploiting the advantage of excluding NMS. In this paper, we propose the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge that addresses the above dilemma. We build RT-DETR in two steps, drawing on the advanced DETR: first we focus on maintaining accuracy while improving speed, followed by maintaining speed while improving accuracy. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to expeditiously process multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion to improve speed. Then, we propose the uncertainty-minimal query selection to provide high-quality initial queries to the decoder, thereby improving accuracy. In addition, RT-DETR supports flexible speed tuning by adjusting the number of decoder layers to adapt to various scenarios without retraining. Our RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 53.1% / 54.3% AP on COCO and 108 / 74 FPS on T4 GPU, outperforming previously advanced YOLOs in both speed and accuracy. We also develop scaled RT-DETRs that outperform the lighter YOLO detectors (S and M models). Furthermore, RT-DETR-R50 outperforms DINO-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and about 21 times in FPS. After pre-training with Objects365, RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 55.3% / 56.2% AP. The project page: this https URL.

Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. --> We conduct experiments on COCO and Objects365 datasets, where RT-DETR is trained on COCO train2017 and validated on COCO val2017 dataset. We report the standard COCO metrics, including AP (averaged over uniformly sampled IoU thresholds ranging from 0.50-0.95 with a step size of 0.05), AP50, AP75, as well as AP at different scales: APS, APM, APL. ### Preprocessing Images are resized to 640x640 pixels and rescaled with and . ### Training Hyperparameters - **Training regime:** <!--fp32, fp16 mixed precision, bf16 mixed precision, bf16 non-mixed precision, fp16 non-mixed precision, fp8 mixed precision --> !image/png ## Evaluation | Model | #Epochs | #Params (M) | GFLOPs | FPS_bs=1 | AP (val) | AP50 (val) | AP75 (val) | AP-s (val) | AP-m (val) | AP-l (val) | |----------------------------|---------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------| | RT-DETR-R18 | 72 | 20 | 60.7 | 217 | 46.5 | 63.8 | 50.4 | 28.4 | 49.8 | 63.0 | | RT-DETR-R34 | 72 | 31 | 91.0 | 172 | 48.5 | 66.2 | 52.3 | 30.2 | 51.9 | 66.2 | | RT-DETR R50 | 72 | 42 | 136 | 108 | 53.1 | 71.3 | 57.7 | 34.8 | 58.0 | 70.0 | | RT-DETR R101| 72 | 76 | 259 | 74 | 54.3 | 72.7 | 58.6 | 36.0 | 58.8 | 72.1 | | RT-DETR-R18 (Objects 365 pretrained) | 60 | 20 | 61 | 217 | 49.2 | 66.6 | 53.5 | 33.2 | 52.3 | 64.8 | | RT-DETR-R50 (Objects 365 pretrained) | 24 | 42 | 136 | 108 | 55.3 | 73.4 | 60.1 | 37.9 | 59.9 | 71.8 | | RT-DETR-R101 (Objects 365 pretrained) | 24 | 76 | 259 | 74 | 56.2 | 74.6 | 61.3 | 38.3 | 60.5 | 73.5 | ### Model Architecture and Objective !image/png Overview of RT-DETR. We feed the features from the last three stages of the backbone into the encoder. The efficient hybrid encoder transforms multi-scale features into a sequence of image features through the Attention-based Intra-scale Feature Interaction (AIFI) and the CNN-based Cross-scale Feature Fusion (CCFF). Then, the uncertainty-minimal query selection selects a fixed number of encoder features to serve as initial object queries for the decoder. Finally, the decoder with auxiliary prediction heads iteratively optimizes object queries to generate categories and boxes. ## Citation <!-- If there is a paper or blog post introducing the model, the APA and Bibtex information for that should go in this section. --> **BibTeX:** ## Model Card Authors Sangbum Choi Pavel Iakubovskii",
