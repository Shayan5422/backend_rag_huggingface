It was built by further training the vinai's bertweet-base language model on the cryptocurrency domain, using a corpus of over 3.2M unique cryptocurrency-related social media posts. (A research paper with more details will follow soon.) ## Classification Training The model was trained on the following labels: \"Bearish\" : 0, \"Neutral\": 1, \"Bullish\": 2 CryptoBERT's sentiment classification head was fine-tuned on a balanced dataset of 2M labelled StockTwits posts, sampled from ElKulako/stocktwits-crypto. CryptoBERT was trained with a max sequence length of 128. Technically, it can handle sequences of up to 514 tokens, however, going beyond 128 is not recommended. # Classification Example ## Training Corpus CryptoBERT was trained on 3.2M social media posts regarding various cryptocurrencies. Only non-duplicate posts of length above 4 words were considered. The following communities were used as sources for our corpora: (1) StockTwits - 1.875M posts about the top 100 cryptos by trading volume. Posts were collected from the 1st of November 2021 to the 16th of June 2022. ElKulako/stocktwits-crypto (2) Telegram - 664K posts from top 5 telegram groups: Binance, Bittrex, huobi global, Kucoin, OKEx. Data from 16.11.2020 to 30.01.2021. Courtesy of Anton. (3) Reddit - 172K comments from various crypto investing threads, collected from May 2021 to May 2022 (4) Twitter - 496K posts with hashtags XBT, Bitcoin or BTC. Collected for May 2018.
