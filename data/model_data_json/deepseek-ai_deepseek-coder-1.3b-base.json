Introduction of Deepseek Coder Deepseek Coder is composed of a series of code language models, each trained from scratch on 2T tokens, with a composition of 87% code and 13% natural language in both English and Chinese. We provide various sizes of the code model, ranging from 1B to 33B versions. Each model is pre-trained on project-level code corpus by employing a window size of 16K and a extra fill-in-the-blank task, to support project-level code completion and infilling. For coding capabilities, Deepseek Coder achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models on multiple programming languages and various benchmarks. - **Massive Training Data**: Trained from scratch on 2T tokens, including 87% code and 13% linguistic data in both English and Chinese languages. - **Highly Flexible & Scalable**: Offered in model sizes of 1.3B, 5.7B, 6.7B, and 33B, enabling users to choose the setup most suitable for their requirements. - **Superior Model Performance**: State-of-the-art performance among publicly available code models on HumanEval, MultiPL-E, MBPP, DS-1000, and APPS benchmarks. - **Advanced Code Completion Capabilities**: A window size of 16K and a fill-in-the-blank task, supporting project-level code completion and infilling tasks. ### 2. Model Summary deepseek-coder-1.3b-base is a 1.3B parameter model with Multi-Head Attention trained on 1 trillion tokens. - **Home Page:** DeepSeek - **Repository:** deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder - **Chat With DeepSeek Coder:** DeepSeek-Coder ### 3.
