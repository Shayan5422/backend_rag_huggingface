    "description": "--- license: \"cc-by-nc-4.0\" tags: - vision - video-classification --- # TimeSformer (base-sized model, fine-tuned on Kinetics-400) TimeSformer model pre-trained on Kinetics-400. It was introduced in the paper TimeSformer: Is Space-Time Attention All You Need for Video Understanding? by Tong et al. and first released in this repository. Disclaimer: The team releasing TimeSformer did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by fcakyon. ## Intended uses & limitations You can use the raw model for video classification into one of the 400 possible Kinetics-400 labels. ### How to use Here is how to use this model to classify a video: For more code examples, we refer to the documentation. ### BibTeX entry and citation info",
