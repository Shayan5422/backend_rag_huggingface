When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz. ## Usage The model can be used directly (without a language model) as follows: ## Evaluation The model can be evaluated as follows on the Indonesian test data of Common Voice. **Test Result**: 14.29 % ## Training The Common Voice , , and synthetic voice datasets were used for training. The script used for training can be found here",
