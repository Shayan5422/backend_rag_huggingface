Trained using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) objective, Vocos can generate waveforms in a single forward pass. Unlike other typical GAN-based vocoders, Vocos does not model audio samples in the time domain. Instead, it generates spectral coefficients, facilitating rapid audio reconstruction through inverse Fourier transform. ## Installation To use Vocos only in inference mode, install it using: If you wish to train the model, install it with additional dependencies: ## Usage ### Reconstruct audio from mel-spectrogram Copy-synthesis from a file: ## Citation If this code contributes to your research, please cite our work: ## License The code in this repository is released under the MIT license.",
