    "description": "--- language: tr license: mit --- # ü§ó + üìö dbmdz Turkish BERT model In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State Library open sources an uncased model for Turkish üéâ # üáπüá∑ BERTurk BERTurk is a community-driven uncased BERT model for Turkish. Some datasets used for pretraining and evaluation are contributed from the awesome Turkish NLP community, as well as the decision for the model name: BERTurk. ## Stats The current version of the model is trained on a filtered and sentence segmented version of the Turkish OSCAR corpus, a recent Wikipedia dump, various OPUS corpora and a special corpus provided by Kemal Oflazer. The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 44,04,976,662 tokens. Thanks to Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC) we could train an uncased model on a TPU v3-8 for 2M steps. For this model we use a vocab size of 128k. ## Model weights Currently only PyTorch-Transformers compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints, please raise an issue! | Model | Downloads | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | []( ‚Ä¢ []( ‚Ä¢ []( ## Usage With Transformers >= 2.3 our BERTurk uncased model can be loaded like: ## Results For results on PoS tagging or NER tasks, please refer to this repository. # Huggingface model hub All models are available on the Huggingface model hub. # Contact (Bugs, Feedback, Contribution and more) For questions about our BERT models just open an issue here ü§ó # Acknowledgments Thanks to Kemal Oflazer for providing us additional large corpora for Turkish.
