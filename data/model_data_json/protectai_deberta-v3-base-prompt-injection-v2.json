The model is designed to enhance security in language model applications by detecting these malicious interventions. ## Model Details - **Fine-tuned by:** Protect AI - **Model type:** deberta-v3-base - **Language(s) (NLP):** English - **License:** Apache License 2.0 - **Finetuned from model:** microsoft/deberta-v3-base ## Intended Uses This model classifies inputs into benign () and injection-detected (). ## Limitations is highly accurate in identifying prompt injections in English. It does not detect jailbreak attacks or handle non-English prompts, which may limit its applicability in diverse linguistic environments or against advanced adversarial techniques. Additionally, we do not recommend using this scanner for system prompts, as it produces false-positives. ## Model Development Over 20 configurations were tested during development to optimize the detection capabilities, focusing on various hyperparameters, training regimens, and dataset compositions. ### Dataset The dataset used for training the model was meticulously assembled from various public open datasets to include a wide range of prompt variations. Additionally, prompt injections were crafted using insights gathered from academic research papers, articles, security competitions, and valuable LLM Guard's community feedback. In compliance with licensing requirements, attribution is given where necessary based on the specific licenses of the source data.
