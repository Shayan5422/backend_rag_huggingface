It was introduced in the paper Masked-attention Mask Transformer for Universal Image Segmentation and first released in this repository. Disclaimer: The team releasing Mask2Former did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team. ## Model description Mask2Former addresses instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation with the same paradigm: by predicting a set of masks and corresponding labels. Hence, all 3 tasks are treated as if they were instance segmentation. Mask2Former outperforms the previous SOTA, MaskFormer both in terms of performance an efficiency by (i) replacing the pixel decoder with a more advanced multi-scale deformable attention Transformer, (ii) adopting a Transformer decoder with masked attention to boost performance without without introducing additional computation and (iii) improving training efficiency by calculating the loss on subsampled points instead of whole masks. !model image ## Intended uses & limitations You can use this particular checkpoint for panoptic segmentation. See the model hub to look for other fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you. ### How to use Here is how to use this model: For more code examples, we refer to the documentation.",
