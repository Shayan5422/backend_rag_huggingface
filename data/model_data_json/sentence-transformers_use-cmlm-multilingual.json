It can be used to map 109 languages to a shared vector space. As the model is based LaBSE, it perform quite comparable on downstream tasks. ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) Using this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed: Then you can use the model like this: ## Full Model Architecture ## Citing & Authors Have a look at universal-sentence-encoder-cmlm/multilingual-base-br for the respective publication that describes this model.",
