    "description": "--- license: apache-2.0 language: - en base_model: - yl4579/StyleTTS2-LJSpeech pipeline_tag: text-to-speech --- **Kokoro** is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects. <audio controls><source src=\" type=\"audio/wav\"></audio> üêà **GitHub**: üöÄ **Demo**: > [!NOTE] > As of April 2025, the market rate of Kokoro served over API is **under $1 per million characters of text input**, or under $0.06 per hour of audio output. (On average, 1000 characters of input is about 1 minute of output.) Sources: ArtificialAnalysis/Replicate at 65 cents per M chars and DeepInfra at 80 cents per M chars. > > This is an Apache-licensed model, and Kokoro has been deployed in numerous projects and commercial APIs. We welcome the deployment of the model in real use cases. > [!CAUTION] > Fake websites like kokorottsai_com (snapshot: and kokorotts_net (snapshot: are likely scams masquerading under the banner of a popular model. > > Any website containing \"kokoro\" in its root domain (e.g. kokorottsai_com, kokorotts_net) is **NOT owned by and NOT affiliated with this model page or its author**, and attempts to imply otherwise are red flags. - Releases - Usage - EVAL.md ‚ÜóÔ∏è - SAMPLES.md ‚ÜóÔ∏è - VOICES.md ‚ÜóÔ∏è - Model Facts - Training Details - Creative Commons Attribution - Acknowledgements ### Releases | Model | Published | Training Data | Langs & Voices | SHA256 | | ----- | --------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------ | | **v1.0** | **2025 Jan 27** | **Few hundred hrs** | **8 & 54** | | | v0.19 | 2024 Dec 25 | <100 hrs | 1 & 10 | | | Training Costs | v0.19 | v1.0 | **Total** | | -------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- | | in A100 80GB GPU hours | 500 | 500 | **1000** | | average hourly rate | $0.80/h | $1.20/h | **$1/h** | | in USD | $400 | $600 | **$1000** | ### Usage You can run this basic cell on Google Colab.

Examples of permissive/non-copyrighted audio include: - Public domain audio - Audio licensed under Apache, MIT, etc - Synthetic audio<sup>[1]</sup> generated by closed<sup>[2]</sup> TTS models from large providers<br/> [1] [2] No synthetic audio from open TTS models or \"custom voice clones\" **Total Dataset Size:** A few hundred hours of audio **Total Training Cost:** About $1000 for 1000 hours of A100 80GB vRAM ### Creative Commons Attribution The following CC BY audio was part of the dataset used to train Kokoro v1.0. | Audio Data | Duration Used | License | Added to Training Set After | | ---------- | ------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | | Koniwa | <1h | CC BY 3.0 | v0.19 / 22 Nov 2024 | | SIWIS | <11h | CC BY 4.0 | v0.19 / 22 Nov 2024 | ### Acknowledgements - üõ†Ô∏è @yl4579 for architecting StyleTTS 2. - üèÜ @Pendrokar for adding Kokoro as a contender in the TTS Spaces Arena. - üìä Thank you to everyone who contributed synthetic training data. - ‚ù§Ô∏è Special thanks to all compute sponsors. - üëæ Discord server: - ü™Ω Kokoro is a Japanese word that translates to \"heart\" or \"spirit\".
