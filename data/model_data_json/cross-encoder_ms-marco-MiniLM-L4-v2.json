The model can be used for Information Retrieval: Given a query, encode the query will all possible passages (e.g. retrieved with ElasticSearch). Then sort the passages in a decreasing order. See SBERT.net Retrieve & Re-rank for more details. The training code is available here: SBERT.net Training MS Marco ## Usage with SentenceTransformers The usage is easy when you have SentenceTransformers installed. Then you can use the pre-trained models like this: ## Usage with Transformers ## Performance In the following table, we provide various pre-trained Cross-Encoders together with their performance on the TREC Deep Learning 2019 and the MS Marco Passage Reranking dataset. | Model-Name | NDCG@10 (TREC DL 19) | MRR@10 (MS Marco Dev) | Docs / Sec | | ------------- |:-------------| -----| --- | | **Version 2 models** | | | | cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L2-v2 | 69.84 | 32.56 | 9000 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L2-v2 | 71.01 | 34.85 | 4100 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L4-v2 | 73.04 | 37.70 | 2500 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 74.30 | 39.01 | 1800 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L12-v2 | 74.31 | 39.02 | 960 | **Version 1 models** | | | | cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L2 | 67.43 | 30.15 | 9000 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L4 | 68.09 | 34.50 | 2900 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L6 | 69.57 | 36.13 | 680 | cross-encoder/ms-marco-electra-base | 71.99 | 36.41 | 340 | **Other models** | | | | nboost/pt-tinybert-msmarco | 63.63 | 28.80 | 2900 | nboost/pt-bert-base-uncased-msmarco | 70.94 | 34.75 | 340 | nboost/pt-bert-large-msmarco | 73.36 | 36.48 | 100 | Capreolus/electra-base-msmarco | 71.23 | 36.89 | 340 | amberoad/bert-multilingual-passage-reranking-msmarco | 68.40 | 35.54 | 330 | sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-cat-margin_mse-T2-msmarco | 72.82 | 37.88 | 720 Note: Runtime was computed on a V100 GPU.",
