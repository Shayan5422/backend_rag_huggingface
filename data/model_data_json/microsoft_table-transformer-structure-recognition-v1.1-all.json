    "description": "--- license: mit --- # Table Transformer (pre-trained for Table Structure Recognition) Table Transformer (TATR) model trained on PubTables1M and FinTabNet.c. It was introduced in the paper Aligning benchmark datasets for table structure recognition by Smock et al. and first released in this repository. Disclaimer: The team releasing Table Transformer did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team. ## Model description The Table Transformer is equivalent to DETR, a Transformer-based object detection model. Note that the authors decided to use the \"normalize before\" setting of DETR, which means that layernorm is applied before self- and cross-attention. ## Usage You can use the raw model for detecting tables in documents. See the documentation for more info.",
