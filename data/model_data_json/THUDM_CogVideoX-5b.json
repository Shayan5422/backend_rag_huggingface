This solution has not been tested for actual VRAM/memory usage on devices other than **NVIDIA A100 / H100**. Generally, this solution can be adapted to all devices with **NVIDIA Ampere architecture** and above. If the optimizations are disabled, VRAM usage will increase significantly, with peak VRAM usage being about 3 times higher than the table shows. However, speed will increase by 3-4 times. You can selectively disable some optimizations, including: + When performing multi-GPU inference, the optimization needs to be disabled. + Using INT8 models will reduce inference speed. This is to ensure that GPUs with lower VRAM can perform inference normally while maintaining minimal video quality loss, though inference speed will decrease significantly. + The 2B model is trained with precision, and the 5B model is trained with precision. We recommend using the precision the model was trained with for inference. + PytorchAO and Optimum-quanto can be used to quantize the text encoder, Transformer, and VAE modules to reduce CogVideoX's memory requirements. This makes it possible to run the model on a free T4 Colab or GPUs with smaller VRAM! It is also worth noting that TorchAO quantization is fully compatible with , which can significantly improve inference speed. precision must be used on devices with or above, which requires installing the , , , and Python packages from source. is recommended. + The inference speed test also used the above VRAM optimization scheme. Without VRAM optimization, inference speed increases by about 10%. Only the version of the model supports quantization. + The model only supports English input; other languages can be translated into English during refinement by a large model. **Note** + Using SAT for inference and fine-tuning of SAT version models. Feel free to visit our GitHub for more information. ## Quick Start ü§ó This model supports deployment using the huggingface diffusers library. You can deploy it by following these steps. **We recommend that you visit our GitHub and check out the relevant prompt optimizations and conversions to get a better experience.** 1. Install the required dependencies 2. Run the code ## Quantized Inference PytorchAO and Optimum-quanto can be used to quantize the Text Encoder, Transformer and VAE modules to lower the memory requirement of CogVideoX. This makes it possible to run the model on free-tier T4 Colab or smaller VRAM GPUs as well! It is also worth noting that TorchAO quantization is fully compatible with , which allows for much faster inference speed. Additionally, the models can be serialized and stored in a quantized datatype to save disk space when using PytorchAO.
