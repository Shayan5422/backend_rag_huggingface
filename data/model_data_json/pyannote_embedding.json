If you are an academic researcher, please cite the relevant papers in your own publications using the model. If you work for a company, please consider contributing back to pyannote.audio development (e.g. through unrestricted gifts). We also provide scientific consulting services around speaker diarization and machine listening.\" extra_gated_fields: Company/university: text Website: text I plan to use this model for (task, type of audio data, etc): text --- Using this open-source model in production? Consider switching to pyannoteAI for better and faster options. # ðŸŽ¹ Speaker embedding Relies on pyannote.audio 2.1: see installation instructions. This model is based on the canonical x-vector TDNN-based architecture, but with filter banks replaced with trainable SincNet features. See []( architecture for implementation details. ## Basic usage Using cosine distance directly, this model reaches 2.8% equal error rate (EER) on VoxCeleb 1 test set. This is without voice activity detection (VAD) nor probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA). Expect even better results when adding one of those. ## Advanced usage ### Running on GPU ### Extract embedding from an excerpt ### Extract embeddings using a sliding window ## Citation"
