Project Page: ## Newsüî•üî•üî• * Aug.26, 2024. üí•üí•üí• Our 8-steps and 16-steps **FLUX.1-dev-related LoRAs** are available now! We recommend LoRA scales around 0.125 that is adaptive with training and guidance scale could be kept on 3.5. Lower step LoRAs would be coming soon. üí•üí•üí• * Aug.19, 2024. SD3-related CFG LoRAs are available now! We recommend setting guidance scale to 3.0/5.0/7.0 at 4/8/16-steps. Don't forget to fuse lora with a relatively small scale (e.g. 0.125 that is adaptive with training) before inference with diffusers. Note that 8-steps and 16-steps LoRA can also inference on a little bit smaller steps like 6-steps and 12-steps, respectively. Hope to hear your feedback, FLUX-related models will be coming next week. * May.13, 2024. The 12-Steps CFG-Preserved Hyper-SDXL-12steps-CFG-LoRA and Hyper-SD15-12steps-CFG-LoRA is also available now(support 5~8 guidance scales), this could be more practical with better trade-off between performance and speed. Enjoy! * Apr.30, 2024. Our 8-Steps CFG-Preserved Hyper-SDXL-8steps-CFG-LoRA and Hyper-SD15-8steps-CFG-LoRA is available now(support 5~8 guidance scales), we strongly recommend making the 8-step CFGLora a standard configuration for all SDXL and SD15 models!!! * Apr.28, 2024. ComfyUI workflows on 1-Step Unified LoRA ü•∞ with TCDScheduler to inference on different steps are released! Remember to install ‚≠ïÔ∏è ComfyUI-TCD in your folder!!! You're encouraged to adjust the eta parameter to get better results üåü! * Apr.26, 2024. Thanks to @Pete for contributing to our scribble demo with larger canvas right now üëè. * Apr.24, 2024. The ComfyUI workflow and checkpoint on 1-Step SDXL UNet ‚ú® is also available! Don't forget ‚≠ïÔ∏è to install the custom scheduler in your folder!!! * Apr.23, 2024. ComfyUI workflows on N-Steps LoRAs are released! Worth a try for creators üí•! * Apr.23, 2024. Our technical report üìö is uploaded to arXiv! Many implementation details are provided and we welcome more discussionsüëè. * Apr.21, 2024. Hyper-SD ‚ö°Ô∏è is highly compatible and work well with different base models and controlnets. To clarify, we also append the usage example of controlnet here. * Apr.20, 2024. Our checkpoints and two demos ü§ó (i.e. SD15-Scribble and SDXL-T2I) are publicly available on HuggingFace Repo. ## Try our Hugging Face demos: Hyper-SD Scribble demo host on ü§ó scribble Hyper-SDXL One-step Text-to-Image demo host on ü§ó T2I ## Introduction Hyper-SD is one of the new State-of-the-Art diffusion model acceleration techniques.
