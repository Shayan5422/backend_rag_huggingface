    "description": "--- thumbnail: tags: - conversational license: mit --- ## A State-of-the-Art Large-scale Pretrained Response generation model (DialoGPT) DialoGPT is a SOTA large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for multiturn conversations. The human evaluation results indicate that the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test. The model is trained on 147M multi-turn dialogue from Reddit discussion thread. * Multi-turn generation examples from an interactive environment: |Role | Response | |---------|--------| |User | Does money buy happiness? | | Bot | Depends how much money you spend on it .| |User | What is the best way to buy happiness ? | | Bot | You just have to be a millionaire by your early 20s, then you can be happy . | |User |This is so difficult ! | | Bot | You have no idea how hard it is to be a millionaire and happy . There is a reason the rich have a lot of money | Please find the information about preprocessing, training and full details of the DialoGPT in the original DialoGPT repository ArXiv paper: ### How to use Now we are ready to try out how the model works as a chatting partner!",
