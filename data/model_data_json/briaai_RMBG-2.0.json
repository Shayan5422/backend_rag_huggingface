The model is designed to effectively separate foreground from background in a range of categories and image types. This model has been trained on a carefully selected dataset, which includes: general stock images, e-commerce, gaming, and advertising content, making it suitable for commercial use cases powering enterprise content creation at scale. The accuracy, efficiency, and versatility currently rival leading source-available models. It is ideal where content safety, legally licensed datasets, and bias mitigation are paramount. Developed by BRIA AI, RMBG v2.0 is available as a source-available model for non-commercial use. ### Get Access Bria RMBG2.0 is availabe everywhere you build, either as source-code and weights, ComfyUI nodes or API endpoints. - **Purchase:** for commercial license simply click Here. - **API Endpoint**: Bria.ai, fal.ai - **ComfyUI**: Use it in workflows For more information, please visit our website.

Available here **Purchase:** to purchase a commercial license simply click Here. - **Model Description:** BRIA RMBG-2.0 is a dichotomous image segmentation model trained exclusively on a professional-grade dataset. - **BRIA:** Resources for more information: BRIA AI ## Training data Bria-RMBG model was trained with over 15,000 high-quality, high-resolution, manually labeled (pixel-wise accuracy), fully licensed images. Our benchmark included balanced gender, balanced ethnicity, and people with different types of disabilities. For clarity, we provide our data distribution according to different categories, demonstrating our model’s versatility. ### Distribution of images: | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:| | Objects only | 45.11% | | People with objects/animals | 25.24% | | People only | 17.35% | | people/objects/animals with text | 8.52% | | Text only | 2.52% | | Animals only | 1.89% | | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------------:| | Photorealistic | 87.70% | | Non-Photorealistic | 12.30% | | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:| | Non Solid Background | 52.05% | | Solid Background | 47.95% | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:| | Single main foreground object | 51.42% | | Multiple objects in the foreground | 48.58% | ## Qualitative Evaluation Open source models comparison !diagram !examples ### Architecture RMBG-2.0 is developed on the BiRefNet architecture enhanced with our proprietary dataset and training scheme. This training data significantly improves the model’s accuracy and effectiveness for background-removal task.<br> If you use this model in your research, please cite: #### Requirements ### Usage <!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->"
