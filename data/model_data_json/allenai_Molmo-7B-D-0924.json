Molmo models are trained on PixMo, a dataset of 1 million, highly-curated image-text pairs. It has state-of-the-art performance among multimodal models with a similar size while being fully open-source. You can find all models in the Molmo family here. **Learn more** about the Molmo family in our announcement blog post or the paper. Molmo 7B-D is based on Qwen2-7B and uses OpenAI CLIP as vision backbone. It performs comfortably between GPT-4V and GPT-4o on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation. It powers the **Molmo demo at** **molmo.allenai.org**. This checkpoint is a **preview** of the Molmo release. All artifacts used in creating Molmo (PixMo dataset, training code, evaluations, intermediate checkpoints) will be made available at a later date, furthering our commitment to open-source AI development and reproducibility. **Sign up here** to be the first to know when artifacts are released.

Your image might not be in RGB format. You can convert it using the following code snippet: ### Molmo doesn't work great with transparent images! We received reports that Molmo models might struggle with transparent images. For the time being, we recommend adding a white or dark background to your images before passing them to the model. The code snippet below shows how to do this using the Python Imaging Library (PIL): ## License and Use This model is licensed under Apache 2.0. It is intended for research and educational use.
