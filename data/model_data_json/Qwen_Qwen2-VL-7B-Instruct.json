This includes base64, URLs, and interleaved images and videos. You can install it using the following command: Here we show a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with and : <details> <summary>Without qwen_vl_utils</summary> </details> <details> <summary>Multi image inference</summary> </details> <details> <summary>Video inference</summary> </details> <details> <summary>Batch inference</summary> </details> ### More Usage Tips For input images, we support local files, base64, and URLs. For videos, we currently only support local files. #### Image Resolution for performance boost The model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage. Besides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model: 1. Define min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels. 2. Specify exact dimensions: Directly set and . These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28. ## Limitations While Qwen2-VL are applicable to a wide range of visual tasks, it is equally important to understand its limitations. Here are some known restrictions: 1. Lack of Audio Support: The current model does **not comprehend audio information** within videos. 2. Data timeliness: Our image dataset is **updated until June 2023**, and information subsequent to this date may not be covered. 3. Constraints in Individuals and Intellectual Property (IP): The model's capacity to recognize specific individuals or IPs is limited, potentially failing to comprehensively cover all well-known personalities or brands. 4. Limited Capacity for Complex Instruction: When faced with intricate multi-step instructions, the model's understanding and execution capabilities require enhancement. 5. Insufficient Counting Accuracy: Particularly in complex scenes, the accuracy of object counting is not high, necessitating further improvements. 6. Weak Spatial Reasoning Skills: Especially in 3D spaces, the model's inference of object positional relationships is inadequate, making it difficult to precisely judge the relative positions of objects. These limitations serve as ongoing directions for model optimization and improvement, and we are committed to continually enhancing the model's performance and scope of application. ## Citation If you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.",
