Similarly to Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, this models is intended for assistant-like chat. - **Out-of-scope:** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in languages other than English. - **Release Date:** 7/23/2024 - **Version:** 1.0 - **License(s):** llama3.1 - **Model Developers:** Neural Magic Quantized version of Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. It achieves an average score of 73.44 on the OpenLLM benchmark (version 1), whereas the unquantized model achieves 73.79. ### Model Optimizations This model was obtained by quantizing the weights and activations of Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to FP8 data type, ready for inference with vLLM built from source. This optimization reduces the number of bits per parameter from 16 to 8, reducing the disk size and GPU memory requirements by approximately 50%. Only the weights and activations of the linear operators within transformers blocks are quantized. Symmetric per-tensor quantization is applied, in which a single linear scaling maps the FP8 representations of the quantized weights and activations. LLM Compressor is used for quantization with 512 sequences of UltraChat. ## Deployment ### Use with vLLM This model can be deployed efficiently using the vLLM backend, as shown in the example below. vLLM aslo supports OpenAI-compatible serving. See the documentation for more details. ## Creation This model was created by applying LLM Compressor with calibration samples from UltraChat, as presented in the code snipet below. ## Evaluation The model was evaluated on MMLU, ARC-Challenge, GSM-8K, Hellaswag, Winogrande and TruthfulQA. Evaluation was conducted using the Neural Magic fork of lm-evaluation-harness (branch llama_3.1_instruct) and the vLLM engine. This version of the lm-evaluation-harness includes versions of ARC-Challenge, GSM-8K, MMLU, and MMLU-cot that match the prompting style of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct-evals. ### Accuracy #### Open LLM Leaderboard evaluation scores <table> <tr> <td><strong>Benchmark</strong> </td> <td><strong>Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct </strong> </td> <td><strong>Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8(this model)</strong> </td> <td><strong>Recovery</strong> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>MMLU (5-shot) </td> <td>67.95 </td> <td>67.97 </td> <td>100.0% </td> </tr> <tr> <td>MMLU-cot (0-shot) </td> <td>71.24 </td> <td>71.12 </td> <td>99.83% </td> </tr> <tr> <td>ARC Challenge (0-shot) </td> <td>82.00 </td> <td>81.66 </td> <td>99.59% </td> </tr> <tr> <td>GSM-8K-cot (8-shot, strict-match) </td> <td>81.96 </td> <td>81.12 </td> <td>98.98% </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hellaswag (10-shot) </td> <td>80.46 </td> <td>80.4 </td> <td>99.93% </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Winogrande (5-shot) </td> <td>78.45 </td> <td>77.90 </td> <td>99.30% </td> </tr> <tr> <td>TruthfulQA (0-shot, mc2) </td> <td>54.50 </td> <td>53.92 </td> <td>98.94% </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Average</strong> </td> <td><strong>73.79</strong> </td> <td><strong>73.44</strong> </td> <td><strong>99.52%</strong> </td> </tr> </table> ### Reproduction The results were obtained using the following commands: #### MMLU #### MMLU-cot #### ARC-Challenge #### GSM-8K #### Hellaswag #### Winogrande #### TruthfulQA",
