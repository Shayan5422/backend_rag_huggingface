With 24 billion parameters, this model achieves top-tier capabilities in both text and vision tasks. This model is an instruction-finetuned version of: Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Base-2503. Mistral Small 3.1 can be deployed locally and is exceptionally \"knowledge-dense,\" fitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized. It is ideal for: - Fast-response conversational agents. - Low-latency function calling. - Subject matter experts via fine-tuning. - Local inference for hobbyists and organizations handling sensitive data. - Programming and math reasoning. - Long document understanding. - Visual understanding. For enterprises requiring specialized capabilities (increased context, specific modalities, domain-specific knowledge, etc.), we will release commercial models beyond what Mistral AI contributes to the community.

If you want to use the model as a general assistant, we recommend the following system prompt: ### vLLM (recommended) We recommend using this model with the vLLM library to implement production-ready inference pipelines. **_Installation_** Make sure you install []( Doing so should automatically install []( To check: You can also make use of a ready-to-go docker image or on the docker hub. #### Server We recommand that you use Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503 in a server/client setting. 1. Spin up a server: **Note:** Running Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503 on GPU requires ~55 GB of GPU RAM in bf16 or fp16. 2. To ping the client you can use a simple Python snippet. ### Function calling Mistral-Small-3.1-24-Instruct-2503 is excellent at function / tool calling tasks via vLLM. *E.g.:* <details> <summary>Example</summary> </details> #### Offline # /\\_/\\ # ( o.o ) # > ^ < # ### Transformers (untested) Transformers-compatible model weights are also uploaded (thanks a lot @cyrilvallez). However the transformers implementation was **not throughly tested**, but only on \"vibe-checks\". Hence, we can only ensure 100% correct behavior when using the original weight format with vllm (see above)."
