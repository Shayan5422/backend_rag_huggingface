So excited for you!\" --- # Fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa-base for Emotion Classification ü§¨ü§¢üòÄüòêüò≠üò≤ # Model Description DistilRoBERTa-base is a transformer model that performs sentiment analysis. I fine-tuned the model on transcripts from the Friends show with the goal of classifying emotions from text data, specifically dialogue from Netflix shows or movies. The model predicts 6 Ekman emotions and a neutral class. These emotions include anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. The model is a fine-tuned version of Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base and DistilRoBERTa-base. This model was initially trained on the following table from Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base: |Name|anger|disgust|fear|joy|neutral|sadness|surprise| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |Crowdflower (2016)|Yes|-|-|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes| |Emotion Dataset, Elvis et al. (2018)|Yes|-|Yes|Yes|-|Yes|Yes| |GoEmotions, Demszky et al. (2020)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes| |ISEAR, Vikash (2018)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|-|Yes|-| |MELD, Poria et al. (2019)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes| |SemEval-2018, EI-reg, Mohammad et al. (2018) |Yes|-|Yes|Yes|-|Yes|-| It was fine-tuned on: |Name|anger|disgust|fear|joy|neutral|sadness|surprise| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |Emotion Lines (Friends)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes| # How to Use # Contact Please reach out to michelleli1999@gmail.com if you have any questions or feedback. # Reference",
