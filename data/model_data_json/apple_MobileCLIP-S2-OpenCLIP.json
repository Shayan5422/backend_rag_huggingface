This repository contains the **MobileCLIP-S2** checkpoint for OpenCLIP. !MobileCLIP Performance Figure ### Highlights * Our smallest variant obtains similar zero-shot performance as OpenAI's ViT-B/16 model while being 4.8x faster and 2.8x smaller. * obtains better avg zero-shot performance than SigLIP's ViT-B/16 model while being 2.3x faster and 2.1x smaller, and trained with 3x less seen samples. * (LT) attains zero-shot ImageNet performance of **77.2%** which is significantly better than recent works like DFN and SigLIP with similar architectures or even OpenAI's ViT-L/14@336. ## Checkpoints | Model | # Seen <BR>Samples (B) | # Params (M) <BR> (img + txt) | Latency (ms) <BR> (img + txt) | IN-1k Zero-Shot <BR> Top-1 Acc.
