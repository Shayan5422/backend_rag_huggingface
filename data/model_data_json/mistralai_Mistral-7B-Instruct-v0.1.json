For full details of this model please read our paper and release blog post. ## Instruction format In order to leverage instruction fine-tuning, your prompt should be surrounded by and tokens. The very first instruction should begin with a begin of sentence id. The next instructions should not. The assistant generation will be ended by the end-of-sentence token id. E.g. This format is available as a chat template via the method: ## Model Architecture This instruction model is based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, a transformer model with the following architecture choices: - Grouped-Query Attention - Sliding-Window Attention - Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer ## Troubleshooting - If you see the following error: Installing transformers from source should solve the issue pip install git+ This should not be required after transformers-v4.33.4. ## Limitations The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs. ## The Mistral AI Team Albert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Lample, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed."
