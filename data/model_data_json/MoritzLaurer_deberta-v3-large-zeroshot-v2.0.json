These models can do classification without training data and run on both GPUs and CPUs. An overview of the latest zeroshot classifiers is available in my Zeroshot Classifier Collection. The main update of this series of models is that several models are trained on fully commercially-friendly data for users with strict license requirements. These models can do one universal classification task: determine whether a hypothesis is \"true\" or \"not true\" given a text ( vs. ). This task format is based on the Natural Language Inference task (NLI). The task is so universal that any classification task can be reformulated into this task by the Hugging Face pipeline. ## Training data Models with a \"\" in the name are trained on two types of fully commercially-friendly data: 1. Synthetic data generated with Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1. I first created a list of 500+ diverse text classification tasks for 25 professions in conversations with Mistral-large. The data was manually curated. I then used this as seed data to generate several hundred thousand texts for these tasks with Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1. The final dataset used is available in the synthetic_zeroshot_mixtral_v0.1 dataset in the subset . Data curation was done in multiple iterations and will be improved in future iterations. 2. Two commercially-friendly NLI datasets: (MNLI, FEVER-NLI). These datasets were added to increase generalization. 3. Models without a \"\" in the name also included a broader mix of training data with a broader mix of licenses: ANLI, WANLI, LingNLI, and all datasets in this list where . ## How to use the models forces the model to decide on only one class. enables the model to choose multiple classes. ## Metrics The models were evaluated on 28 different text classification tasks with the f1_macro metric. The main reference point is which is, at the time of writing (03.04.24), the most used commercially-friendly 0-shot classifier. !results_aggreg_v2.0 | | facebook/bart-large-mnli | roberta-base-zeroshot-v2.0-c | roberta-large-zeroshot-v2.0-c | deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v2.0-c | deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v2.0 (fewshot) | deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2.0-c | deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2.0 (fewshot) | bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0-c | bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0 (fewshot) | |:---------------------------|---------------------------:|-----------------------------:|------------------------------:|--------------------------------:|-----------------------------------:|---------------------------------:|------------------------------------:|-----------------------:|--------------------------:| | all datasets mean | 0.497 | 0.587 | 0.622 | 0.619 | 0.643 (0.834) | 0.676 | 0.673 (0.846) | 0.59 | (0.803) | | amazonpolarity (2) | 0.937 | 0.924 | 0.951 | 0.937 | 0.943 (0.961) | 0.952 | 0.956 (0.968) | 0.942 | (0.951) | | imdb (2) | 0.892 | 0.871 | 0.904 | 0.893 | 0.899 (0.936) | 0.923 | 0.918 (0.958) | 0.873 | (0.917) | | appreviews (2) | 0.934 | 0.913 | 0.937 | 0.938 | 0.945 (0.948) | 0.943 | 0.949 (0.962) | 0.932 | (0.954) | | yelpreviews (2) | 0.948 | 0.953 | 0.977 | 0.979 | 0.975 (0.989) | 0.988 | 0.985 (0.994) | 0.973 | (0.978) | | rottentomatoes (2) | 0.83 | 0.802 | 0.841 | 0.84 | 0.86 (0.902) | 0.869 | 0.868 (0.908) | 0.813 | (0.866) | | emotiondair (6) | 0.455 | 0.482 | 0.486 | 0.459 | 0.495 (0.748) | 0.499 | 0.484 (0.688) | 0.453 | (0.697) | | emocontext (4) | 0.497 | 0.555 | 0.63 | 0.59 | 0.592 (0.799) | 0.699 | 0.676 (0.81) | 0.61 | (0.798) | | empathetic (32) | 0.371 | 0.374 | 0.404 | 0.378 | 0.405 (0.53) | 0.447 | 0.478 (0.555) | 0.387 | (0.455) | | financialphrasebank (3) | 0.465 | 0.562 | 0.455 | 0.714 | 0.669 (0.906) | 0.691 | 0.582 (0.913) | 0.504 | (0.895) | | banking77 (72) | 0.312 | 0.124 | 0.29 | 0.421 | 0.446 (0.751) | 0.513 | 0.567 (0.766) | 0.387 | (0.715) | | massive (59) | 0.43 | 0.428 | 0.543 | 0.512 | 0.52 (0.755) | 0.526 | 0.518 (0.789) | 0.414 | (0.692) | | wikitoxic_toxicaggreg (2) | 0.547 | 0.751 | 0.766 | 0.751 | 0.769 (0.904) | 0.741 | 0.787 (0.911) | 0.736 | (0.9) | | wikitoxic_obscene (2) | 0.713 | 0.817 | 0.854 | 0.853 | 0.869 (0.922) | 0.883 | 0.893 (0.933) | 0.783 | (0.914) | | wikitoxic_threat (2) | 0.295 | 0.71 | 0.817 | 0.813 | 0.87 (0.946) | 0.827 | 0.879 (0.952) | 0.68 | (0.947) | | wikitoxic_insult (2) | 0.372 | 0.724 | 0.798 | 0.759 | 0.811 (0.912) | 0.77 | 0.779 (0.924) | 0.783 | (0.915) | | wikitoxic_identityhate (2) | 0.473 | 0.774 | 0.798 | 0.774 | 0.765 (0.938) | 0.797 | 0.806 (0.948) | 0.761 | (0.931) | | hateoffensive (3) | 0.161 | 0.352 | 0.29 | 0.315 | 0.371 (0.862) | 0.47 | 0.461 (0.847) | 0.291 | (0.823) | | hatexplain (3) | 0.239 | 0.396 | 0.314 | 0.376 | 0.369 (0.765) | 0.378 | 0.389 (0.764) | 0.29 | (0.729) | | biasframes_offensive (2) | 0.336 | 0.571 | 0.583 | 0.544 | 0.601 (0.867) | 0.644 | 0.656 (0.883) | 0.541 | (0.855) | | biasframes_sex (2) | 0.263 | 0.617 | 0.835 | 0.741 | 0.809 (0.922) | 0.846 | 0.815 (0.946) | 0.748 | (0.905) | | biasframes_intent (2) | 0.616 | 0.531 | 0.635 | 0.554 | 0.61 (0.881) | 0.696 | 0.687 (0.891) | 0.467 | (0.868) | | agnews (4) | 0.703 | 0.758 | 0.745 | 0.68 | 0.742 (0.898) | 0.819 | 0.771 (0.898) | 0.687 | (0.892) | | yahootopics (10) | 0.299 | 0.543 | 0.62 | 0.578 | 0.564 (0.722) | 0.621 | 0.613 (0.738) | 0.587 | (0.711) | | trueteacher (2) | 0.491 | 0.469 | 0.402 | 0.431 | 0.479 (0.82) | 0.459 | 0.538 (0.846) | 0.471 | (0.518) | | spam (2) | 0.505 | 0.528 | 0.504 | 0.507 | 0.464 (0.973) | 0.74 | 0.597 (0.983) | 0.441 | (0.978) | | wellformedquery (2) | 0.407 | 0.333 | 0.333 | 0.335 | 0.491 (0.769) | 0.334 | 0.429 (0.815) | 0.361 | (0.718) | | manifesto (56) | 0.084 | 0.102 | 0.182 | 0.17 | 0.187 (0.376) | 0.258 | 0.256 (0.408) | 0.147 | (0.331) | | capsotu (21) | 0.34 | 0.479 | 0.523 | 0.502 | 0.477 (0.664) | 0.603 | 0.502 (0.686) | 0.472 | (0.644) | These numbers indicate zeroshot performance, as no data from these datasets was added in the training mix. Note that models without a \"\" in the title were evaluated twice: one run without any data from these 28 datasets to test pure zeroshot performance (the first number in the respective column) and the final run including up to 500 training data points per class from each of the 28 datasets (the second number in brackets in the column, \"fewshot\"). No model was trained on test data. Details on the different datasets are available here: ## When to use which model - **deberta-v3-zeroshot vs. roberta-zeroshot**: deberta-v3 performs clearly better than roberta, but it is a bit slower. roberta is directly compatible with Hugging Face's production inference TEI containers and flash attention. These containers are a good choice for production use-cases. tl;dr: For accuracy, use a deberta-v3 model. If production inference speed is a concern, you can consider a roberta model (e.g. in a TEI container and HF Inference Endpoints). - **commercial use-cases**: models with \"\" in the title are guaranteed to be trained on only commercially-friendly data. Models without a \"\" were trained on more data and perform better, but include data with non-commercial licenses. Legal opinions diverge if this training data affects the license of the trained model. For users with strict legal requirements, the models with \"\" in the title are recommended. - **Multilingual/non-English use-cases**: use bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0 or bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0-c. Note that multilingual models perform worse than English-only models. You can therefore also first machine translate your texts to English with libraries like EasyNMT and then apply any English-only model to the translated data. Machine translation also facilitates validation in case your team does not speak all languages in the data. - **context window**: The models can process up to 8192 tokens. The other models can process up to 512. Note that longer text inputs both make the mode slower and decrease performance, so if you're only working with texts of up to 400~ words / 1 page, use e.g. a deberta model for better performance. - The latest updates on new models are always available in the Zeroshot Classifier Collection. ## Reproduction Reproduction code is available in the directory here: ## Limitations and bias The model can only do text classification tasks. Biases can come from the underlying foundation model, the human NLI training data and the synthetic data generated by Mixtral. ## License The foundation model was published under the MIT license. The licenses of the training data vary depending on the model, see above. ## Citation This model is an extension of the research described in this paper.
