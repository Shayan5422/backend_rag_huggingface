It was introduced in the paper PubTables-1M: Towards Comprehensive Table Extraction From Unstructured Documents by Smock et al. and first released in this repository. Disclaimer: The team releasing Table Transformer did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team. ## Model description The Table Transformer is equivalent to DETR, a Transformer-based object detection model. Note that the authors decided to use the \"normalize before\" setting of DETR, which means that layernorm is applied before self- and cross-attention. ## Usage You can use the raw model for detecting tables in documents. See the documentation for more info.",
