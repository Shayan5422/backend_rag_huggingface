The fingerprints numerically represent polymer chemical structures. Please see the license agreement in the LICENSE file. <!--- Describe your model here --> ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) Using this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed: Then you can use the model like this: ## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers) Without sentence-transformers, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings. ## Evaluation Results See and paper on arXiv. ## Full Model Architecture ## Citing & Authors Kuenneth, C., Ramprasad, R. polyBERT: a chemical language model to enable fully machine-driven ultrafast polymer informatics.
