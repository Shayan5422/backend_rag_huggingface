For more details, please see, Facebook FAIR's WMT19 News Translation Task Submission. The abbreviation FSMT stands for FairSeqMachineTranslation All four models are available: * wmt19-en-ru * wmt19-ru-en * wmt19-en-de * wmt19-de-en ## Intended uses & limitations #### How to use #### Limitations and bias - The original (and this ported model) doesn't seem to handle well inputs with repeated sub-phrases, content gets truncated ## Training data Pretrained weights were left identical to the original model released by fairseq. For more details, please, see the paper. ## Eval results pair | fairseq | transformers -------|---------|---------- de-en | 42.3 | 41.35 The score is slightly below the score reported by , since --num_beams 50`. ## Data Sources - training, etc. - test set ### BibTeX entry and citation info ## TODO - port model ensemble (fairseq uses 4 model checkpoints)",
