It was introduced in the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition and first released in this repository. Disclaimer: The team releasing ResNet did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team. ## Model description ResNet introduced residual connections, they allow to train networks with an unseen number of layers (up to 1000). ResNet won the 2015 ILSVRC & COCO competition, one important milestone in deep computer vision. !model image ## Intended uses & limitations You can use the raw model for image classification. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you. ### How to use Here is how to use this model: For more code examples, we refer to the documentation.",
