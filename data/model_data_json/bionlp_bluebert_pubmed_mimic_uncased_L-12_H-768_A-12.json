    "description": "--- language: - en tags: - bert - bluebert license: cc0-1.0 datasets: - PubMed - MIMIC-III --- # BlueBert-Base, Uncased, PubMed and MIMIC-III ## Model description A BERT model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and clinical notes (MIMIC-III). ## Intended uses & limitations #### How to use Please see ## Training data We provide preprocessed PubMed texts that were used to pre-train the BlueBERT models. The corpus contains ~4000M words extracted from the PubMed ASCII code version. Pre-trained model: ## Training procedure * lowercasing the text * removing speical chars - * tokenizing the text using the NLTK Treebank tokenizer Below is a code snippet for more details. ### BibTeX entry and citation info ### Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine and Clinical Center.
