For example: --- Note: Having a separate repo for ONNX weights is intended to be a temporary solution until WebML gains more traction. If you would like to make your models web-ready, we recommend converting to ONNX using ðŸ¤— Optimum and structuring your repo like this one (with ONNX weights located in a subfolder named ).",
