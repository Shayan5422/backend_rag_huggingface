TTMs are lightweight forecasters, pre-trained on publicly available time series data with various augmentations. TTM provides state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasts and can easily be fine-tuned for multi-variate forecasts with just 5% of the training data to be competitive. Refer to our paper for more details. **The current open-source version supports point forecasting use-cases specifically ranging from minutely to hourly resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.).** **Note that zeroshot, fine-tuning and inference tasks using TTM can easily be executed in 1 GPU machine or in laptops too!!** **New updates:** TTM-R1 comprises TTM variants pre-trained on 250M public training samples. We have another set of TTM models released recently under TTM-R2 trained on a much larger pretraining dataset (~700M samples) which can be accessed from here. In general, TTM-R2 models perform better than TTM-R1 models as they are trained on larger pretraining dataset. However, the choice of R1 vs R2 depends on your target data distribution. Hence requesting users to try both R1 and R2 variants and pick the best for your data. ## Model Description TTM falls under the category of “focused pre-trained models”, wherein each pre-trained TTM is tailored for a particular forecasting setting (governed by the context length and forecast length). Instead of building one massive model supporting all forecasting settings, we opt for the approach of constructing smaller pre-trained models, each focusing on a specific forecasting setting, thereby yielding more accurate results. Furthermore, this approach ensures that our models remain extremely small and exceptionally fast, facilitating easy deployment without demanding a ton of resources. Hence, in this model card, we plan to release several pre-trained TTMs that can cater to many common forecasting settings in practice. Additionally, we have released our source code along with our pretraining scripts that users can utilize to pretrain models on their own. Pretraining TTMs is very easy and fast, taking only 3-6 hours using 6 A100 GPUs, as opposed to several days or weeks in traditional approaches. Each pre-trained model will be released in a different branch name in this model card. Kindly access the required model using our getting started notebook mentioning the branch name. ## Model Releases (along with the branch name where the models are stored): - **512-96:** Given the last 512 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length) in future. This model is targeted towards a forecasting setting of context length 512 and forecast length 96 and recommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). This model refers to the TTM-Q variant used in the paper. (branch name: main) [[Benchmark Scripts]]( - **1024-96:** Given the last 1024 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length) in future. This model is targeted towards a long forecasting setting of context length 1024 and forecast length 96 and recommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). (branch name: 1024-96-v1) [[Benchmark Scripts]]( We can also use the [[get_model]]( utility to automatically select the required model based on your input context length and forecast length requirement. For more variants (till forecast length 720), refer to our new model card here ## Model Capabilities with example scripts The below model scripts can be used for any of the above TTM models.

Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. For more details, refer to our paper TTM-Q referred in the paper maps to the model uploaded in the main branch. For other variants (TTM-B, TTM-E and TTM-A) please refer here. For more details, refer to the paper. <p align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"> <img src=\"benchmarks.webp\" width=\"600\"> </p> ## Recommended Use 1. Users have to externally standard scale their data independently for every channel before feeding it to the model (Refer to TSP, our data processing utility for data scaling.) 2. The current open-source version supports only minutely and hourly resolutions(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.). Other lower resolutions (say weekly, or monthly) are currently not supported in this version, as the model needs a minimum context length of 512 or 1024. 3. Enabling any upsampling or prepending zeros to virtually increase the context length for shorter-length datasets is not recommended and will impact the model performance. ## Model Details For more details on TTM architecture and benchmarks, refer to our paper. TTM-1 currently supports 2 modes: - **Zeroshot forecasting**: Directly apply the pre-trained model on your target data to get an initial forecast (with no training). - **Finetuned forecasting**: Finetune the pre-trained model with a subset of your target data to further improve the forecast. **Since, TTM models are extremely small and fast, it is practically very easy to finetune the model with your available target data in few minutes to get more accurate forecasts.** The current release supports multivariate forecasting via both channel independence and channel-mixing approaches. Decoder Channel-Mixing can be enabled during fine-tuning for capturing strong channel-correlation patterns across time-series variates, a critical capability lacking in existing counterparts. In addition, TTM also supports exogenous infusion and categorical data infusion. ### Model Sources - **Repository:** - **Paper:** ### Blogs and articles on TTM: - Refer to our wiki ## Uses ## Training Data The original r1 TTM models were trained on a collection of datasets from the Monash Time Series Forecasting repository.
