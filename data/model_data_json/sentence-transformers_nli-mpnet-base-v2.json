    "description": "--- license: apache-2.0 library_name: sentence-transformers tags: - sentence-transformers - feature-extraction - sentence-similarity - transformers pipeline_tag: sentence-similarity --- # sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2 This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search. ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) Using this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed: Then you can use the model like this: ## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers) Without sentence-transformers, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings. ## Full Model Architecture ## Citing & Authors This model was trained by sentence-transformers.
