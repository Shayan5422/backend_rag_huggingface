For more technical details of the original MMDiT architecture, please refer to the Research paper. ### Model Performance See blog for our study about comparative performance in prompt adherence and aesthetic quality. ## File Structure Click here to access the Files and versions tab ## Using with Diffusers Upgrade to the latest version of the üß® diffusers library and then you can run ### Quantizing the model with diffusers Reduce your VRAM usage and have the model fit on ü§è VRAM GPUs ### Fine-tuning Please see the fine-tuning guide here. ## Uses ### Intended Uses Intended uses include the following: * Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes. * Applications in educational or creative tools. * Research on generative models, including understanding the limitations of generative models. All uses of the model must be in accordance with our Acceptable Use Policy. ### Out-of-Scope Uses The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events. As such, using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope of the abilities of this model. ## Safety As part of our safety-by-design and responsible AI deployment approach, we take deliberate measures to ensure Integrity starts at the early stages of development. We implement safety measures throughout the development of our models. We have implemented safety mitigations that are intended to reduce the risk of certain harms, however we recommend that developers conduct their own testing and apply additional mitigations based on their specific use cases. For more about our approach to Safety, please visit our Safety page. ### Integrity Evaluation Our integrity evaluation methods include structured evaluations and red-teaming testing for certain harms. Testing was conducted primarily in English and may not cover all possible harms. ### Risks identified and mitigations: * Harmful content: We have used filtered data sets when training our models and implemented safeguards that attempt to strike the right balance between usefulness and preventing harm. However, this does not guarantee that all possible harmful content has been removed. TAll developers and deployers should exercise caution and implement content safety guardrails based on their specific product policies and application use cases. * Misuse: Technical limitations and developer and end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of models. All users are required to adhere to our Acceptable Use Policy, including when applying fine-tuning and prompt engineering mechanisms. Please reference the Stability AI Acceptable Use Policy for information on violative uses of our products. * Privacy violations: Developers and deployers are encouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with techniques that respect data privacy. ### Contact Please report any issues with the model or contact us: * Safety issues: safety@stability.ai * Security issues: security@stability.ai * Privacy issues: privacy@stability.ai * License and general: * Enterprise license:"
