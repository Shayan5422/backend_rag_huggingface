For the fine-tuning, we used the ASTD, ArSAS, and SemEval datasets. Our fine-tuning procedure and the hyperparameters we used can be found in our paper *\"The Interplay of Variant, Size, and Task Type in Arabic Pre-trained Language Models.\"* Our fine-tuning code can be found here. ## Intended uses You can use the CAMeLBERT Mix SA model directly as part of our CAMeL Tools SA component (*recommended*) or as part of the transformers pipeline. #### How to use To use the model with the CAMeL Tools SA component: You can also use the SA model directly with a transformers pipeline: *Note*: to download our models, you would need . Otherwise, you could download the models manually. ## Citation",
