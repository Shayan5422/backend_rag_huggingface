    "description": "--- license: apache-2.0 tags: - vision - image-classification datasets: - imagenet-1k --- # ResNet-50 v1.5 ResNet model pre-trained on ImageNet-1k at resolution 224x224. It was introduced in the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition by He et al. Disclaimer: The team releasing ResNet did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team. ## Model description ResNet (Residual Network) is a convolutional neural network that democratized the concepts of residual learning and skip connections. This enables to train much deeper models. This is ResNet v1.5, which differs from the original model: in the bottleneck blocks which require downsampling, v1 has stride = 2 in the first 1x1 convolution, whereas v1.5 has stride = 2 in the 3x3 convolution. This difference makes ResNet50 v1.5 slightly more accurate (\\~0.5% top1) than v1, but comes with a small performance drawback (~5% imgs/sec) according to Nvidia. !model image ## Intended uses & limitations You can use the raw model for image classification. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you. ### How to use Here is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes: For more code examples, we refer to the documentation. ### BibTeX entry and citation info",
