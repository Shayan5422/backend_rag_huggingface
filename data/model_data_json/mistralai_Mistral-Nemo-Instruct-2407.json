Trained jointly by Mistral AI and NVIDIA, it significantly outperforms existing models smaller or similar in size. For more details about this model please refer to our release blog post. ## Key features - Released under the **Apache 2 License** - Pre-trained and instructed versions - Trained with a **128k context window** - Trained on a large proportion of **multilingual and code data** - Drop-in replacement of Mistral 7B ## Model Architecture Mistral Nemo is a transformer model, with the following architecture choices: - **Layers:** 40 - **Dim:** 5,120 - **Head dim:** 128 - **Hidden dim:** 14,336 - **Activation Function:** SwiGLU - **Number of heads:** 32 - **Number of kv-heads:** 8 (GQA) - **Vocabulary size:** 2**17 ~= 128k - **Rotary embeddings (theta = 1M)** ## Metrics ### Main Benchmarks | Benchmark | Score | | --- | --- | | HellaSwag (0-shot) | 83.5% | | Winogrande (0-shot) | 76.8% | | OpenBookQA (0-shot) | 60.6% | | CommonSenseQA (0-shot) | 70.4% | | TruthfulQA (0-shot) | 50.3% | | MMLU (5-shot) | 68.0% | | TriviaQA (5-shot) | 73.8% | | NaturalQuestions (5-shot) | 31.2% | ### Multilingual Benchmarks (MMLU) | Language | Score | | --- | --- | | French | 62.3% | | German | 62.7% | | Spanish | 64.6% | | Italian | 61.3% | | Portuguese | 63.3% | | Russian | 59.2% | | Chinese | 59.0% | | Japanese | 59.0% | ## Usage The model can be used with three different frameworks - []( See here - []( See here - []( See nvidia/Mistral-NeMo-12B-Instruct ### Mistral Inference #### Install It is recommended to use with mistral-inference. For HF transformers code snippets, please keep scrolling. #### Download #### Chat After installing , a CLI command should be available in your environment. You can chat with the model using *E.g.* Try out something like: #### Instruct following #### Function calling ### Transformers > [!IMPORTANT] > NOTE: Until a new release has been made, you need to install transformers from source: > If you want to use Hugging Face to generate text, you can do something like this. ## Function calling with To use this example, you'll need version 4.42.0 or higher. Please see the function calling guide in the docs for more information. Note that, for reasons of space, this example does not show a complete cycle of calling a tool and adding the tool call and tool results to the chat history so that the model can use them in its next generation. For a full tool calling example, please see the function calling guide, and note that Mistral **does** use tool call IDs, so these must be included in your tool calls and tool results. They should be exactly 9 alphanumeric characters. > [!TIP] > Unlike previous Mistral models, Mistral Nemo requires smaller temperatures. We recommend to use a temperature of 0.3. ## Limitations The Mistral Nemo Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs. ## The Mistral AI Team Albert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Alexis Tacnet, Alok Kothari, Antoine Roux, Arthur Mensch, Audrey Herblin-Stoop, Augustin Garreau, Austin Birky, Bam4d, Baptiste Bout, Baudouin de Monicault, Blanche Savary, Carole Rambaud, Caroline Feldman, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Eleonore Arcelin, Emma Bou Hanna, Etienne Metzger, Gaspard Blanchet, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, Harizo Rajaona, Henri Roussez, Hichem Sattouf, Ian Mack, Jean-Malo Delignon, Jessica Chudnovsky, Justus Murke, Kartik Khandelwal, Lawrence Stewart, Louis Martin, Louis Ternon, Lucile Saulnier, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Margaret Jennings, Marie Pellat, Marie Torelli, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Marjorie Janiewicz, Mickaël Seznec, Nicolas Schuhl, Niklas Muhs, Olivier de Garrigues, Patrick von Platen, Paul Jacob, Pauline Buche, Pavan Kumar Reddy, Perry Savas, Pierre Stock, Romain Sauvestre, Sagar Vaze, Sandeep Subramanian, Saurabh Garg, Sophia Yang, Szymon Antoniak, Teven Le Scao, Thibault Schueller, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Théophile Gervet, Timothée Lacroix, Valera Nemychnikova, Wendy Shang, William El Sayed, William Marshall"
