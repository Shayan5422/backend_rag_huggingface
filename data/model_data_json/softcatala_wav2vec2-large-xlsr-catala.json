A custom split was used combining both the CommonVoice and ParlamentParla dataset and can be found here. Evaluating on the CV test dataset will produce a biased WER as 1144 audio files of that dataset were used in training/evaluation of this model. WER was calculated using this test.csv which was not seen by the model during training/evaluation. You can find training and evaluation scripts in the github repository ccoreilly/wav2vec2-catala When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz. ## Results Word error rate was evaluated on the following datasets unseen by the model: | Dataset | WER | | ------- | --- | | Test split CV+ParlamentParla) | 6.92% | | Google Crowsourced Corpus | 12.99% | | Audiobook “La llegenda de Sant Jordi” | 13.23% | ## Usage The model can be used directly (without a language model) as follows:",
