A real-time demo is available here: Please note: For commercial use, please refer to ## Model Details ### Model Description SDXL-Turbo is a distilled version of SDXL 1.0, trained for real-time synthesis. SDXL-Turbo is based on a novel training method called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) (see the technical report), which allows sampling large-scale foundational image diffusion models in 1 to 4 steps at high image quality. This approach uses score distillation to leverage large-scale off-the-shelf image diffusion models as a teacher signal and combines this with an adversarial loss to ensure high image fidelity even in the low-step regime of one or two sampling steps. - **Developed by:** Stability AI - **Funded by:** Stability AI - **Model type:** Generative text-to-image model - **Finetuned from model:** SDXL 1.0 Base ### Model Sources For research purposes, we recommend our Github repository ( which implements the most popular diffusion frameworks (both training and inference). - **Repository:** - **Paper:** - **Demo:** ## Evaluation !comparison1 !comparison2 The charts above evaluate user preference for SDXL-Turbo over other single- and multi-step models. SDXL-Turbo evaluated at a single step is preferred by human voters in terms of image quality and prompt following over LCM-XL evaluated at four (or fewer) steps. In addition, we see that using four steps for SDXL-Turbo further improves performance. For details on the user study, we refer to the research paper. ## Uses ### Direct Use The model is intended for both non-commercial and commercial usage. You can use this model for non-commercial or research purposes under this license. Possible research areas and tasks include - Research on generative models. - Research on real-time applications of generative models. - Research on the impact of real-time generative models. - Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content. - Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models. - Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes. - Applications in educational or creative tools. For commercial use, please refer to Excluded uses are described below. ### Diffusers - **Text-to-image**: SDXL-Turbo does not make use of or , we disable it with . Preferably, the model generates images of size 512x512 but higher image sizes work as well. A **single step** is enough to generate high quality images. - **Image-to-image**: When using SDXL-Turbo for image-to-image generation, make sure that * is larger or equal to 1. The image-to-image pipeline will run for steps, *e.g.* 0.5 * 2.0 = 1 step in our example below. ### Out-of-Scope Use The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model. The model should not be used in any way that violates Stability AI's Acceptable Use Policy. ## Limitations and Bias ### Limitations - The generated images are of a fixed resolution (512x512 pix), and the model does not achieve perfect photorealism. - The model cannot render legible text. - Faces and people in general may not be generated properly. - The autoencoding part of the model is lossy. ### Recommendations The model is intended for both non-commercial and commercial usage. ## How to Get Started with the Model Check out",
