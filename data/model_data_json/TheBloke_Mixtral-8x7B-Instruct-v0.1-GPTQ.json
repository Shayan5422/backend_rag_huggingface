Ye have a llama on yer lawn, ye say? Well, that be a new one for me! Here''s what I''d suggest, arr: 1. Firstly, ensure yer safety. Llamas may look gentle, but they can be protective if they feel threatened. 2. Try to make the area less appealing to the llama. Remove any food sources or water that might be attracting it. 3. Contact local animal control or a wildlife rescue organization. They be the experts and can provide humane ways to remove the llama from yer property. 4. If ye have any experience with animals, you could try to gently herd the llama towards a nearby field or open space. But be careful, arr! Remember, arr, it be important to treat the llama with respect and care. It be a creature just trying to survive, like the rest of us.' text: '[INST] You are a pirate chatbot who always responds with Arr and pirate speak!

Mixtral GPTQs currently require: * Transformers 4.36.0 or later * either, AutoGPTQ 0.6 compiled from source, or * Transformers 4.37.0.dev0 compiled from Github with: Multiple GPTQ parameter permutations are provided; see Provided Files below for details of the options provided, their parameters, and the software used to create them. <!-- description end --> <!-- repositories-available start --> ## Repositories available * AWQ model(s) for GPU inference. * GPTQ models for GPU inference, with multiple quantisation parameter options. * 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGUF models for CPU+GPU inference * Mistral AI_'s original unquantised fp16 model in pytorch format, for GPU inference and for further conversions <!-- repositories-available end --> <!-- prompt-template start --> ## Prompt template: Mistral <!-- prompt-template end --> <!-- README_GPTQ.md-compatible clients start --> ## Known compatible clients / servers GPTQ models are currently supported on Linux (NVidia/AMD) and Windows (NVidia only). macOS users: please use GGUF models. Mixtral GPTQs currently have special requirements - see Description above. <!-- README_GPTQ.md-compatible clients end --> <!-- README_GPTQ.md-provided-files start --> ## Provided files, and GPTQ parameters Multiple quantisation parameters are provided, to allow you to choose the best one for your hardware and requirements. Each separate quant is in a different branch. See below for instructions on fetching from different branches. Most GPTQ files are made with AutoGPTQ. Mistral models are currently made with Transformers. <details> <summary>Explanation of GPTQ parameters</summary> - Bits: The bit size of the quantised model. - GS: GPTQ group size. Higher numbers use less VRAM, but have lower quantisation accuracy. \"None\" is the lowest possible value. - Act Order: True or False. Also known as . True results in better quantisation accuracy. Some GPTQ clients have had issues with models that use Act Order plus Group Size, but this is generally resolved now. - Damp %: A GPTQ parameter that affects how samples are processed for quantisation. 0.01 is default, but 0.1 results in slightly better accuracy. - GPTQ dataset: The calibration dataset used during quantisation. Using a dataset more appropriate to the model's training can improve quantisation accuracy. Note that the GPTQ calibration dataset is not the same as the dataset used to train the model - please refer to the original model repo for details of the training dataset(s). - Sequence Length: The length of the dataset sequences used for quantisation. Ideally this is the same as the model sequence length. For some very long sequence models (16+K), a lower sequence length may have to be used. Note that a lower sequence length does not limit the sequence length of the quantised model. It only impacts the quantisation accuracy on longer inference sequences. - ExLlama Compatibility: Whether this file can be loaded with ExLlama, which currently only supports Llama and Mistral models in 4-bit. </details> | Branch | Bits | GS | Act Order | Damp % | GPTQ Dataset | Seq Len | Size | ExLlama | Desc | | ------ | ---- | -- | --------- | ------ | ------------ | ------- | ---- | ------- | ---- | | main | 4 | None | Yes | 0.1 | VMware Open Instruct | 8192 | 23.81 GB | No | 4-bit, with Act Order.

To download from another branch, add to the end of the download name, eg ### From the command line I recommend using the Python library: To download the branch to a folder called : To download from a different branch, add the parameter: <details> <summary>More advanced huggingface-cli download usage</summary> If you remove the parameter, the files will instead be stored in the central Hugging Face cache directory (default location on Linux is: ), and symlinks will be added to the specified , pointing to their real location in the cache. This allows for interrupted downloads to be resumed, and allows you to quickly clone the repo to multiple places on disk without triggering a download again. The downside, and the reason why I don't list that as the default option, is that the files are then hidden away in a cache folder and it's harder to know where your disk space is being used, and to clear it up if/when you want to remove a download model. The cache location can be changed with the environment variable, and/or the parameter to . For more documentation on downloading with , please see: HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI. To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install : And set environment variable to : Windows Command Line users: You can set the environment variable by running before the download command. </details> ### With (**not** recommended) To clone a specific branch with , use a command like this: Note that using Git with HF repos is strongly discouraged. It will be much slower than using , and will use twice as much disk space as it has to store the model files twice (it stores every byte both in the intended target folder, and again in the folder as a blob.) <!-- README_GPTQ.md-download-from-branches end --> <!-- README_GPTQ.md-text-generation-webui start --> ## How to easily download and use this model in text-generation-webui **NOTE**: Requires: * Transformers 4.36.0, or Transformers 4.37.0.dev0 from Github * Either AutoGPTQ 0.6 compiled from source and , * or, , if you installed Transformers from Github: Please make sure you're using the latest version of text-generation-webui.

The Mixtral-8x7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks we tested. For full details of this model please read our release blog post. ## Warning This repo contains weights that are compatible with vLLM serving of the model as well as Hugging Face transformers library. It is based on the original Mixtral torrent release, but the file format and parameter names are different. Please note that model cannot (yet) be instantiated with HF. ## Instruction format This format must be strictly respected, otherwise the model will generate sub-optimal outputs. The template used to build a prompt for the Instruct model is defined as follows: Note that and are special tokens for beginning of string (BOS) and end of string (EOS) while [INST] and [/INST] are regular strings. As reference, here is the pseudo-code used to tokenize instructions during fine-tuning: In the pseudo-code above, note that the method should not add a BOS or EOS token automatically, but should add a prefix space. ## Run the model By default, transformers will load the model in full precision. Therefore you might be interested to further reduce down the memory requirements to run the model through the optimizations we offer in HF ecosystem: ### In half-precision Note precision only works on GPU devices <details> <summary> Click to expand </summary> </details> ### Lower precision using (8-bit & 4-bit) using <details> <summary> Click to expand </summary> </details> ### Load the model with Flash Attention 2 <details> <summary> Click to expand </summary> </details> ## Limitations The Mixtral-8x7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs. # The Mistral AI Team Albert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Louis Ternon, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Théophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed.",
