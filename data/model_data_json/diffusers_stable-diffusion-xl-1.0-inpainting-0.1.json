The SD-XL Inpainting 0.1 was initialized with the weights. The model is trained for 40k steps at resolution 1024x1024 and 5% dropping of the text-conditioning to improve classifier-free classifier-free guidance sampling. For inpainting, the UNet has 5 additional input channels (4 for the encoded masked-image and 1 for the mask itself) whose weights were zero-initialized after restoring the non-inpainting checkpoint. During training, we generate synthetic masks and, in 25% mask everything. ## How to use **How it works:** | :-------------------------:|:-------------------------:| <img src=\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/> | <img src=\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/> | :-------------------------:|:-------------------------:| <span style=\"position: relative;bottom: 150px;\">a tiger sitting on a park bench</span> | <img src=\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/> ## Model Description - **Developed by:** The Diffusers team - **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generative model - **License:** CreativeML Open RAIL++-M License - **Model Description:** This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. It is a Latent Diffusion Model that uses two fixed, pretrained text encoders (OpenCLIP-ViT/G and CLIP-ViT/L). ## Uses ### Direct Use The model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and tasks include - Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes. - Applications in educational or creative tools. - Research on generative models. - Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content. - Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models. Excluded uses are described below. ### Out-of-Scope Use The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model. ## Limitations and Bias ### Limitations - The model does not achieve perfect photorealism - The model cannot render legible text - The model struggles with more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere” - Faces and people in general may not be generated properly. - The autoencoding part of the model is lossy. - When the strength parameter is set to 1 (i.e. starting in-painting from a fully masked image), the quality of the image is degraded. The model retains the non-masked contents of the image, but images look less sharp. We're investing this and working on the next version. ### Bias While the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases.",
