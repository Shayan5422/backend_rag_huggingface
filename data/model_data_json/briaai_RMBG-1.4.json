This model has been trained on a carefully selected dataset, which includes: general stock images, e-commerce, gaming, and advertising content, making it suitable for commercial use cases powering enterprise content creation at scale. The accuracy, efficiency, and versatility currently rival leading source-available models. It is ideal where content safety, legally licensed datasets, and bias mitigation are paramount. Developed by BRIA AI, RMBG v1.4 is available as a source-available model for non-commercial use. To purchase a commercial license, simply click Here.

To purchase a commercial license simply click Here. - **Model Description:** BRIA RMBG 1.4 is a saliency segmentation model trained exclusively on a professional-grade dataset. - **BRIA:** Resources for more information: BRIA AI ## Training data Bria-RMBG model was trained with over 12,000 high-quality, high-resolution, manually labeled (pixel-wise accuracy), fully licensed images. Our benchmark included balanced gender, balanced ethnicity, and people with different types of disabilities. For clarity, we provide our data distribution according to different categories, demonstrating our model’s versatility. ### Distribution of images: | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:| | Objects only | 45.11% | | People with objects/animals | 25.24% | | People only | 17.35% | | people/objects/animals with text | 8.52% | | Text only | 2.52% | | Animals only | 1.89% | | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------------:| | Photorealistic | 87.70% | | Non-Photorealistic | 12.30% | | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:| | Non Solid Background | 52.05% | | Solid Background | 47.95% | Category | Distribution | | -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:| | Single main foreground object | 51.42% | | Multiple objects in the foreground | 48.58% | ## Qualitative Evaluation !examples ## Architecture RMBG v1.4 is developed on the IS-Net enhanced with our unique training scheme and proprietary dataset. These modifications significantly improve the model’s accuracy and effectiveness in diverse image-processing scenarios. ## Installation ## Usage Either load the pipeline Or load the model",
