(2021) and Bender et al. (2021)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. ## Recommendations Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations. # Training Details ## Training Data The model craters note in the Github Repository > We train unsupervised SimCSE on 106 randomly sampled sentences from English Wikipedia, and train supervised SimCSE on the combination of MNLI and SNLI datasets (314k). ## Training Procedure ### Preprocessing More information needed ### Speeds, Sizes, Times More information needed # Evaluation ## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics ### Testing Data The model craters note in the associated paper > Our evaluation code for sentence embeddings is based on a modified version of SentEval. It evaluates sentence embeddings on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and downstream transfer tasks. For STS tasks, our evaluation takes the \"all\" setting, and report Spearman's correlation. See associated paper (Appendix B) for evaluation details. ### Factors ### Metrics More information needed ## Results More information needed # Model Examination More information needed # Environmental Impact Carbon emissions can be estimated using the Machine Learning Impact calculator presented in Lacoste et al.
