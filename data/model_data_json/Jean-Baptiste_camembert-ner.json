Model was trained on wikiner-fr dataset (~170 634 sentences). Model was validated on emails/chat data and overperformed other models on this type of data specifically. In particular the model seems to work better on entity that don't start with an upper case. ## Training data Training data was classified as follow: Abbreviation|Description -|- O |Outside of a named entity MISC |Miscellaneous entity PER |Person’s name ORG |Organization LOC |Location ## How to use camembert-ner with HuggingFace ##### Load camembert-ner and its sub-word tokenizer : ## Model performances (metric: seqeval) Overall precision|recall|f1 -|-|- 0.8859|0.8971|0.8914 By entity entity|precision|recall|f1 -|-|-|- PER|0.9372|0.9598|0.9483 ORG|0.8099|0.8265|0.8181 LOC|0.8905|0.9005|0.8955 MISC|0.8175|0.8117|0.8146 For those who could be interested, here is a short article on how I used the results of this model to train a LSTM model for signature detection in emails:",
