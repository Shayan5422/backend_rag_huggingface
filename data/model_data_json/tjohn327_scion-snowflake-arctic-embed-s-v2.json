It introduces Isolation Domains (ISDs) as groups of ASes sharing a common jurisdiction. SCION is path-aware, i.e., end hosts can choose from available forwarding paths and encode the desired one in the SCION header as what is known as packet-carried forwarding state (PCFS). Hence, the SCION data plane does not rely on longest prefix matching to determine the next hop router. Instead, SCION routers examine the hop fields (HF) in the SCION header which directly encode the AS-level path by means of interface IDs (IFIDs). Each AS can uniquely map its IFIDs to a neighbor and even a cer- tain link in case there are multiple links to this neighbor. Together with the source AS, the chain of ingress and egress IFIDs uniquely describes a SCION path. The hop fields are cryptographically signed by the AS corresponding to the hop with an AES-CMAC truncated to 6 bytes. To avoid forgery of HFs, SCION border routers must check the CMAC of every HF they use to make a forwarding deci- sion. Packets with invalid HFs should be dropped. In most cases, a HF corresponds to a specific border router, requiring each of them to only validate a single HF. Hop fields are grouped into segments resulting in a special case where a border router has to check two HFs when the path switches from one segment to another and the AS ingress and egress router happen to be the same device. The AES-CMAC is calculated over a 128 bit pseudo-header. As this matches up with the block size of the AES cipher, a single round of AES encryption is sufficient to generate the authentication tag, excluding the subkey derivation AES-CMAC calls for. A precise de- scription of the AES-CMAC algorithm is available in the correspond- ing RFC [15]. AES-128 is widely supported in commodity server hardware, making HF checks much faster than lookups in Internet- scale IP routing tables [3]. However, the switching ASICs used in hardware routers designed over decades to efficiently forward IP traffic do not include AES in their forwarding logic. Fortunately, re- cent P4-programmable switches have sufficient match-action stages to implement AES in standard P4 [4]. For more information on SCION we refer to the corresponding literature [3, 5, 19]. 2.2 Tofino Architecture We develop our SCION border router for Intel Tofino 2 switches. The P4 programmable Tofino architecture is an embodiment of the Protocol Independent Switching Architecture (PISA) data plane model. PISA switches contain three major types of programmable components: parsers, deparsers, and match-action units (MAUs). In the Tofino architecture, switch pipes consist of an in- and an egress pipeline each containing its own parser, MAUs and deparser [18]. Each switch pipe is hardwired to a set of, in case of Tofino 2, 8x 400G Ethernet ports [1]. The number of operations that can be performed per pipeline is limited. If a program exhausts the resources of one pipeline, the programmer can recirculate packets in order to process them itera- tively. If a packet is diverted to a different pipeline and recirculated there, there is the option to process the same packet sequentially with different P4 programs as each pipeline can be programmed independently. This is the key to fit the SCION border router in a Tofino 2 switch as described in Section 5.1. 3 RELATED WORK The SCION reference border router is implemented in Go [2] and uses regular IP/UDP sockets for packet I/O. Although being multi- threaded, the reference border router is not suitable for high traffic volume. Schulz et al. have proposed a BPF implementation of SCION packet forwarding [14] which achieves a throughput of 0.676 Mpps per core within a virtual machine test environment. However, the BPF data path has not been integrated in the reference border router yet. A commercial DPDK-based SCION router software is available from Anapaya Systems [17], but to our knowledge no production- ready SCION routers exist in hardware. The first attempt at a hardware implementation of SCION was made by Součková, targeting a NetFPGA SUME development board programmable in P4 [16]. The full 10 Gbit/s line rate of the devel- opment platform has been achieved in experiments. However, the SCION packet parser and cryptographic validation circuitry did not fit in the FPGA at the same time due to inefficient workarounds that had to be taken to handle SCION’s non-standard header layout. Nevertheless, the project led to improvements to SCION’s header layout making it more suitable for high-speed processing. A first implementation of SCION for Tofino 1 was presented by de Ruiter et al. [7] being capable of processing packets at 100 Gbit/s line rate. However, as Tofino does not support cryptographic opera- tions in hardware, the AES-CMAC hop field validation in de Ruiter’s approach relies on a pre-populated table of valid hop fields. This simplification works as current SCION deployments change valida- tion keys infrequently. An unfortunate consequence of this design is that the SCION router is no longer stateless and instead has to communicate with the path discovery and registration services of the AS to obtain valid hop fields. Furthermore, the lookup-table solution also prevents the deployment of the SCION extensions EPIC [ 11] and Colibri [ 9] which rely on MACs that do not just change per-path, but per-packet. Nevertheless, the P4 code pub- lished by de Ruiter et al. inspired our work and is incorporated in our implementation. Chen has shown that it is possible to implement an AES encryp- tion in a Tofino 1 switch using so called scrambled lookup tables [4]. Their implementation was limited to an encryption throughput of 10.92 Gbit/s due to limited recirculation capacity. Our work addresses the issues encountered by Součková and de Ruiter et al. We implement the SCION packet parsing and validation logic separately in different pipelines of a Tofino 2 switch in order to bridge the gap between SCION’s requirements and achieving line-rate throughput. We furthermore develop an approach to AES in P4 that takes full advantage of the resources provided by Tofino 2 realizing the first 400G line-rate packet validator for SCION. 18 </content>' - 'Book excerpt providing an overview of LightningFilter operation.

We deﬁne a trafﬁc proﬁle as a sequence of measurements over a speciﬁc period of time (proﬁling window) on a per-ﬂow basis (ﬂow count). As long as the trafﬁc of a ﬂow is within such a trafﬁc proﬁle, its packets are guaranteed to be processed.4 • Enabling traditional ﬁrewalls to ﬁlter packets using metadata: The system should enable traditional ﬁrewalls to employ meaningful rule- based packet ﬁltering using packet metadata (such as the 5-tuple in the packet header). Without LightningFilter, these ﬁltering rules can be cir- cumvented by spooﬁng attacks due to the lack of authentication. • Elimination of collateral damage across domains: The system should guarantee that compromised domains cannot introduce collateral dam- age on non-compromised domains by consuming all available resources. Legitimate clients within a compromised domain, however, may be af- fected by an adversary consuming excessive resources at a target domain. This provides an incentive for domain owners to eliminate attack trafﬁc sent by their end hosts. • Non-goal: Guaranteed trafﬁc delivery to the domain is not a goal of this system, but can be achieved by a complementary system in SCION. 9.2.2 Overview of LightningFilter Considering our threat model, the adversary’s goal is to consume all available processing resources to prevent legitimate clients from reaching a target ser- vice, e.g., by sending an excessive number of requests. To prevent a single en- tity from achieving this goal, the available processing resources should be sub- divided and distributed among all clients. However, allocating an equal share of resources to each entity inhibits high utilization and potentially punishes benign trafﬁc. As a consequence, researchers have suggested the use of more dynamic approaches, such as history-based ﬁltering [ 213, 407] or binning of requests [ 470]. The potentially huge number of clients poses a challenge to the former approaches, as storing a trafﬁc history (e.g., packet counters) per client is impractical. Instead, we propose to aggregate and store trafﬁc proﬁles at the level of domains, i.e., ASes. These trafﬁc proﬁles denote a sequence 4The replay-suppression system causes a negligible number of packets to be dropped due to false positives; however, end hosts must be able to handle packet loss anyway. 209 </content>' - \"Technical document on SCION CP-PKI trust model and terminology specification.\\ \\ Defines terms like base TRC, TRC signing ceremony, TRC update (regular/sensitive),\\ \\ voting ASes, voting quorum, grace period, trust reset.

End-to-End Security. In the context of mediating customers’ IP endpoints via a secure backbone, the end-to-end communication path can be segmented into an external (insecure) segment, which is comprised of the Internet links between an IP endpoint and the SBAS ingress/egress point, and an internal segment between an arbitrary ingress and egress pair of the secure routing infrastructure. Therefore, to ensure end-to-end secure routing, the follow- ing conditions must hold: (1) Customers must be able to select trusted in- gress/egress points and securely exchange packets with hijack resilience; and (2) the secure backbone must deliver the security properties it promised to any pairs of ingress/egress points even in the presence of internal adversaries. Routing Priority. To enable customers to route trafﬁc from/to the Internet through a secure backbone, SBAS must disseminate the customers’ preﬁx an- nouncements to all other customers and external entities. Preﬁxes will then be announced via SBAS and the Internet, resulting in competing announcements. To maximize the ability to route securely, SBAS must be able to convince the entities receiving the announcements to prioritize routing paths through the secure backbone over the insecure Internet paths. 13.5.3.2 Secure Route Redistribution The internal structure of SBAS can be abstracted to a full-mesh topology be- tween the PoPs, which communicate over SCION. Over these connections, the PoPs redistribute announcements from SBAS customers as well as the In- ternet, akin to the operation of iBGP in a regular AS. To prevent tampering by non-PoP members, the iBGP sessions run over an encrypted and authenticated connection (such as a VPN tunnel). SBAS offers a high degree of ﬂexibility to its customers through support for dynamic route redistribution. Contrary to a traditional AS, which is controlled by a single entity, the redistribution scheme to be used in SBAS must support its federated structure and remain secure in the presence of malicious mem- bers. In the following, we describe the design and security aspects of the route redistribution mechanism. The system distinguishes between three categories of addresses: • Secure addresses: This includes preﬁxes announced by SBAS cus- tomers and SBAS-owned address spaces, which are assigned to cus- tomers. Secure address spaces are announced publicly at egress points via BGP. • Internal addresses: In order to provide an internal addressing scheme among PoPs, e.g., to set up iBGP sessions between PoP routers, the PoPs 348 </content>' - 'Research paper titled \"ID-INT: Secure Inter-Domain In-Band Telemetry\" proposing ID-INT, a SCION extension for secure, authenticated in-band telemetry.

Until now, INT has mostly been deployed in data center environments or single operator W ANs, because it lacks mechanisms for authentication and is not widely standardized. SCION is a novel, path-based Internet architecture providing strong resilience and security properties. In this paper, we propose Inter-domain In-band Network Telemetry (ID-INT) as a protocol extension for SCION. ID-INT leverages SCION’s public key infrastructure to authenticate telemetry data while augmenting SCION’s end host path control with real-time network information. Promising applications of ID-INT include intra-AS path tracing, congestion control, SLA verification, and carbon-aware routing. We implement ID-INT in the open-source SCION stack and provide a proof of concept for an AS-hosted telemetry collection service. We show that cryptographically authenticated ID-INT can be fully implemented in the SCION router’s fast-path with no measurable impact on router per- formance. If optional encryption is employed in addition to authentication, router throughput drops by no more than 13% even if every packet carries telemetry. Index Terms—In-band Network Telemetry, SCION, W AN I. I NTRODUCTION Network monitoring and measurement is an integral part of any network operator’s toolkit. In order to meet the demands of modern real-time applications, constant monitoring of the network’s status and performance is required. Traditionally, networks have been monitored through active measurements using probe packets, e.g., using the well-known ping and traceroute commands, or through passive traffic monitoring at routers. Passive monitoring is usually employing sampling techniques as observing every single packet is costly. With the advent of SDN, programmable data planes, and P4, a new network monitoring paradigm emerged in the form of push-based network telemetry. Telemetry-enabled devices push network measurements to a central controller, instead of waiting for the controller to poll monitoring data. Fully programmable network devices like Intel’s Tofino [1] enable to push telemetry one step further by offloading the collection of telemetry metadata entirely to the data plane. Noticeably, the INT specification [2] was developed as a standardized way to exchange telemetry information between network entities. The INT framework is related to a number of earlier systems all based around the idea of embedding telemetry instructions and is some cases metadata as well in packet headers [3], [4]. INT has in turn inspired research on advanced in-band telemetry protocols like ML-INT for optical networks [5] and probabilistic approaches like PINT [6]. All these systems have in common that they can only be deployed in networks under shared administrative control. Additionally, security and privacy aspects have largely been ignored, precluding Internet- wide deployment. The SCION Internet architecture [7] has been developed to address the lack of security-by-design in today’s Internet based on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP’s design limitations have caused numerous outages. SCION provides a public key infrastructure for authenticating network entities and allows multiple roots of trust to coexist. Another core feature of SCION is that it is a path-based routing protocol. End hosts include the AS-level forwarding path in packet headers to eliminate uncertainties in traditional routing. The same property also allows end hosts to send traffic to a specific destination over multiple parallel paths to increase reliability and aggregate bandwidth. SCION has been successfully de- ployed in both research [8] and commercial networks [9] and already reaches hundreds of thousands devices. A challenge of the end host routing approach is to provide sufficient information for making routing decisions to hosts. Current solutions (cf. [10]–[12]) are based on control plane messages and cannot provide real-time feedback from routers to hosts. Therefore, SCION path selection is mostly based on end-to- end measurements, which become challenging as the number of available paths grows with the number of SCION ASes. In order to address the absence of real-time telemetry in SCION and INT’s lack of an authentication infrastructure and inter-operator compatibility, we introduce Inter-Domain In- band Network Telemetry (ID-INT). ID-INT relies on SCION’s Dynamically Recreatable Key (DRKey) system to provide efficient message authentication in the data plane and in turn allows SCION end host to make informed routing decisions. This work is structured as follows: We continue with a brief description of SCION in section II and provide an overview of related work in and outside the SCION ecosystem in section III. ID-INT’s design is presented in section IV. section V provides details on our prototype implementation which we evaluate for throughput and overhead in section VI, before we discuss potential extensions to the protocol in section VII. Finally, section VIII gives an outlook on a wide range of applications, while section IX concludes this paper. 2024 20th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM) 978-3-903176-66-9 ©2024 IFIP </content>' - 'Master''s thesis excerpt detailing scoring functions for \"passive\" and \"active\" path selection mechanisms in SCION. \"Passive\" mechanism modifies QoE function (Equation 4.4), with increased loss penalty: (if loss < 0.05).

For the ’naive’ and ’shortest path’ mechanisms, the application will select the path at the begin- ning. ’Naive’ chooses uniformly at random from all available paths while ’shortest path’ chooses uniformly at random from the subset of the shortest paths, i.e.,the paths with the fewest hops or fewest ASes in it. Shortest path does not necessarily mean paths with the lowest latency but paths with the fewest hops. The selected path gets a high score and all others a low score. The score is set to low score when the sending rate is higher or equal than previously and there was loss previously except for low sending rates. This gives them the behavior of starting at a low sending rate, increasing when no loss is detected and decreasing when it is, mirroring the functionality of ABR. These two mechanisms do not require any probing. The ’passive’ mechanism uses latency only probing. The core of its scoring function is the score function defined in Equation 4.4. That function scores the QoE for VCAs and as the mechanisms are supposed to optimize the quality, it is a good starting point. However, early testing showed that this is too accepting of loss, only changing paths or sending rate after 10% of loss occurs. After 10% the score drops significantly and to avoid that, the scoring function used internally by the mechanisms has a lower threshold. The internal score function is given by replacing Equation 4.2 with penalty loss = ( 5000 ∗ loss if loss < 0.05 104 ∗ loss else (5.2) It punishes loss more; this is to get a tradeoff between optimizing for QoE and limiting congestion. There are some more modifications for the implementation. The loss on a path is only known when traffic was sent, otherwise it will be assumed zero. Additionally, the ’passive’ mechanism also performs a sending rate selection similar to ’naive’ and ’shortest path’. When sending over a new path, i.e., a path that was not sent over since the last probing and for which 37 </content>' - source_sentence: What is the default output of the command sentences: - \"Research paper section on a Security Analysis of PILA.

Bootstrapping Steps. The end host bootstrapper daemon performs the fol- lowing steps: 1. Probe the local network for hints about a bootstrapping server address us- ing the available discovery mechanisms (i.e., DHCP, DNS, and mDNS). 2. Wait for hints from the discoverers. 3. Once a hint is received, try to download the TRCs and the topology of the AS from the bootstrapping server. While there is no maximum amount of TRCs to be served, the bootstrapping server must provide at least the TRC of the ISD in which the AS is located. a) On success, prepare the SD’s ﬁles and exit successfully; the SD is then automatically started by the orchestrator. b) On failure, go back to step 2. If no hint is received after a certain period, the bootstrapper daemon times out and exits with a non-zero value. Note that the TRCs retrieval is a transition solution to ease adoption; ideally they are installed on a device out-of-band, before the device gets connected to a network (more details are given in the security considerations on page 331). 13.2.3 Discovery Mechanisms A bootstrapper can leverage DHCP, DNS or mDNS in order to ﬁnd the IP address of the bootstrapping server. We describe each case, where we assume that • the end host is located in the example.comdomain; and • the IP address of the bootstrapping server is 192.168.1.1. DHCP. The DHCP mechanism relies on the presence of an existing DHCP server in the network. This mechanism is advantageous in environments where there is a managed DHCP server, but no dedicated DNS infrastructure is oper- ated for the local network. The DHCP server has to be conﬁgured to announce the address of the dis- covery services using one of the DHCP options. One natural choice is to use the option ﬁeld with ID 72 “Default WWW server”, given that HTTP, the same application-level protocol as used in the WWW, is used to retrieve the conﬁg- uration ﬁles. In our example, we would set the option value to 192.168.1.1. 328 </content>' - source_sentence: How might operators of large replicated services manage their own ISD sentences: - 'Research paper on PISKES providing background on source address validation limitations (SAV/BCP 38), cookie-based systems, and client certificates.

Here we focus on several representative and well-known systems—an exhaustive overview of related work is provided in §8. 3.1 Authentication Systems 3.1.1 Source Address Validation. Source address validation (SAV), also known as best current practice (BCP) 38 [ 24], is not an au- thentication system in the strict sense but is still often considered a solution to source-address spoofing in the Internet. With SAV, ASes monitor traffic originating from their own hosts and filter out packets with a source address outside their own address space. However, due to incentive misalignments,2 the adoption of SAV has been slow and a recent study found that many ASes still do not employ it in their networks [46]. Furthermore, it is impossible to determine from the outside if a particular AS employs SAV or if a particular packet originated from an AS that employs SAV as it does not carry any proof of authenticity. For an external service it is therefore impossible to filter traffic based on whether it originated from an AS employing SAV. Even with a full deployment of SAV in the Internet, on-path adversaries would still be able to spoof the source of packets and SAV thus provides very weak security properties. There exists a wide range of other filtering techniques with similarly limited properties [4, 21, 34, 43, 56]. 3.1.2 Cookies. Several protocols, including TLS [63], IKEv2 [38], and DNS [22] define a cookie mechanism to provide a weak form of source authentication. The basic mechanism for these systems is similar: Upon receiving a request, the server replies to the sender with a cookie that encodes the request parameters without allo- cating state or processing the request. Only after receiving this cookie back from the source, the request is processed. Compared to SAV, cookies have the advantage that they can be enforced by services without relying on Internet service providers (ISPs) to perform filtering. However, cookies introduce additional latency of one round-trip time (RTT) and are still susceptible to spoofed packets by on-path adversaries. 3.1.3 Client Certificates. Strong authentication properties can be achieved through asymmetric cryptography and client certificates. These are supported, for example, by TLS [63] and DTLS [64]. How- ever, authentication using client certificates requires expensive asymmetric cryptography in violation of our efficiency require- ments (§2.1.2). Furthermore, these systems cannot authenticate the first packet and are vulnerable to signature-flooding attacks. 3.2 Key-Distribution Systems 3.2.1 Passport. Passport [44] provides mechanisms to establish shared keys between any pair of ASes based on a DH key exchange piggybacked on BGP messages. It relies on a secure routing system to ensure the authenticity of the shared keys, which can subse- quently be used to authenticate the source of packets at the network layer. For our purposes (see §2), Passport by itself is inadequate for several reasons: (i) it only enables authentication at the AS level, (ii) it requires authenticating systems to keep a store of symmetric keys for all ASes (currently approximately 68 000 [6]), (iii) it has 2The costs of deploying SAV are paid by an AS itself while its benefits are experienced by the rest of the Internet.

Other systems, such as Kerberos [54], are reviewed in §8. 3.2.2 DRKey. Dynamically Recreatable Keys (DRKeys) have been proposed to efficiently derive and distribute symmetric shared keys between routers and end hosts in the context of Origin and Path Trace (OPT) [41], a system providing path validation. The system has later been generalized and embedded in the SCION Internet architecture [58]. DRKey’s fundamental idea is that each AS 𝐴 can efficiently derive a key hierarchy starting from a secret value 𝑆𝑉𝐴, providing keys shared with other ASes, 𝐾𝐴→𝐵, and end hosts, 𝐾𝐴→𝐵:𝐻𝐵. By periodically exchanging the keys 𝐾𝐴→𝐵 between ASes, from which host-level keys can be derived, DRKey enables an efficient global distribution of symmetric keys. DRKey fulfills most of our requirements to a key-distribution system and thus provides the basis of PISKES. However, PISKES refines and extends the existing DRKey system [58] in several sig- nificant ways: (i) PISKES modifies DRKey to make it applicable to the current Internet in addition to SCION; (ii) it adds efficient mech- anisms to delegate specific keys to services in an AS; (iii) it specifies many of its important practical aspects in further detail; and (iv) it fixes recently discovered vulnerabilities of DRKey’s key-exchange mechanisms due to an inadequate application of signatures [33]. 4 KEY DERIVATION AND DISTRIBUTION In this section, we present the key-derivation and -distribution mechanisms used for PISKES. This is based on the DRKey sys- tem [58], but we significantly extend it with additional delegation mechanisms and other optimizations, see also §3.2.2. Furthermore, we also formally model and verify security properties of this key- distribution system, see §7.1. We first provide a high-level overview to convey an intuition of the operation of our system.

Springer International Publishing AG, 2022. </citation> <type> book </type> <page> 90 </page> <content> 4 Control Plane 4.2.1 Initiating Beaconing Each core AS, through its beacon service, periodically initiates the path explo- ration process by creating an initial PCB and propagating it. The PCB is either sent to a child AS (in the case of intra-ISD beaconing) or to other core ASes (in the case of core beaconing). The beacon service inserts (among other infor- mation) the initial AS entry ASE0 in the PCB. In the intra-ISD case, the initial PCB can optionally contain peer entries to non-core ASes. The hop entry HE inside ASE0 includes an initial hop ﬁeld with the ingress interface identiﬁer set to ‚ (which indicates an empty value): HF0 “ x FlagsHF } ExpTime } ‚ } ConsEgress } HFAuthy. (4.9) The initial hop ﬁeld denotes the extremity of a path segment and authenti- cates a forwarding decision for every packet that • enters the AS through the interface ConsEgress and terminates in the AS; • originates from the AS and exits through the interface ConsEgress; or • switches to another path segment at this AS (using one of the possible path-segment combinations, as described in § 5.5). The beacon service then signs the PCB and sends it to a border router (which corresponds to the ConsEgress identiﬁer as speciﬁed in the hop ﬁeld). PCBs are disseminated within packets addressed to the beacon service using the corresponding service address (see § 4.6). Furthermore, the special one- hop path is used to initiate the communication to a neighboring beacon service (see § 5.4.1). This is necessary because there may not be a full forwarding path available for beaconing. Indeed, the discovery of such paths in turn relies on beaconing. The purpose of one-hop paths is thus to break this circular dependency. During core beaconing, the neighboring AS that receives the PCB can be in the same or in a different ISD. The ISD identiﬁer included in the PCB’s signature metadata describes only the ISD of the PCB’s originator. 4.2.2 Propagating PCBs After beaconing is initiated, each PCB is propagated in the following way: The ingress border router of the next AS in the beaconing path receives the PCB, detects that the destination is a SCION service address, and sends it to the AS’s beacon service. The beacon service veriﬁes the structure and all signatures on the PCB. The PCB contains the version numbers of the TRC(s) 3 and certiﬁcate(s) that must be used to verify the signatures. This enables the 3Even within a single ISD, there can be multiple valid TRCs at the same time, see § 3.1.6. 70 </content>' - 'Research paper describing the \"Multiple Advertisements\" approach for Anycast in SCION.

Discusses addressing limitations (single ISD) and potential workarounds. <citation> Dennis Eijkel. \"Anycast in the SCION Internet Architecture.\" 2022. </citation> <type> research paper </type> <page> 20 </page> <content> Addressing In the multiple advertisements solution, the same AS number is advertised from different points in the network, thus making the AS replicated and therefore also the services that reside inside of it. A SCION address is a triple of (ISD, AS, address) and does not allow for multiple ISD or AS identifiers in a single address. Therefore to have a single address for all of the different replicas that make up the service, all of the replicas must be put in the same AS that resides in a single ISD. A way to work around this limitation would be to extend the addressing format of SCION, either by allowing multiple ISD identifiers in the same address or a wildcard instead of the ISD identifier. Putting a wildcard in the address in the place of the ISD identifier would make that the address does not have the hijacking protection through isolation that regular SCION addresses have, thus possibly allowing for hijacking of routes. This means that traffic for that wildcard address can route to any ISD that hosts that AS number in their network, the rightful owner of the AS number has no control over which ISDs the traffic intended for their network would end up. Putting multiple ISD identifiers in a single address would mean that we would get practically the same system as the naming solution described in Section 3.3, where instead of through the naming system, alternate replicas are given in a single address. The conclusion is that both of these workarounds are not favorable. ISD considerations Considering the issues that exist around the addressing described before, replicated AS would be part of a (single) regular ISD that might also have ASes that are not replicated. But it is also possible to have dedicated ISD(s) for replicated services. These could come in multiple different forms. Operators of big replicated services might want to run their own ISD. These ISDs would then only have core ASes or only a limited number of non-core ASes. The core ASes would then have many peerings with other ISD cores at different geographical locations. Replicated service operators are probably not interested in providing transit for traffic through their ISD, thus they would not propagate beacons that would lead to paths that travel through their ISD being created. Another scenario could be that there are third parties that operate an anycast ISD and provide transit service to customers that want to operate a replicated service. The anycast ISD operator would operate the ISD core ASes and peer those with many other cores. Customers can then peer at multiple locations with (some of) the anycast core(s). 19 </content>' - source_sentence: How is the concept of configurable rates in Z-Lane intended to accommodate varying traffic demands sentences: - 'Research paper setup description section detailing the specific SCIONLab configuration, including AS creation, attachment to ETHZ-AP, and VM setup.

Once this configuration phase was completed, SCIONLab web inter- face provided a unique ASN for our AS, along with cryptographic keys and public-key certificates. Subsequently, a Vagrant file for our AS was generated to instruct the configuration of a Virtual Machine (VM) that represents our AS. This file made the setup process lightweight by automating the installation of SCIONLAB services, relevant packages, and necessary configurations. Finally we were ready to use a fully configured VM belonging to the global SCIONLab topology. 3.3 Available Applications The VM configuration process also installs a predefined set of SCION applications. The SCION apps that we used in our experi- ments are: • scion address : this command returns the relevant SCION address information for the local host, that is, our AS where we launch commands from. • scion showpaths : it lists available paths between the local and the specified AS. By default, the list is set to display 10 paths only, it can be extended using the-moption. Moreover, a really useful feature for this work, is the—extendedoption, which provides additional information for each path (e.g. MTU, Path Status, Latency info). • scion ping : it tests connectivity to a remote SCION host using SCMP echo packets[4]. When the —countoption is en- abled, the ping command sends a specific number of SCMP echo packets and provides a report with corresponding statis- tics. Furthermore, the real innovation is the —interactive mode option, which displays all the available paths for the specified destination allowing the user to select the desired traffic route. • scion traceroute : it traces the SCION path to a remote AS using SCMP traceroute packets. It is particularly useful to test how the latency is affected by each link. Even this command makes interactive mode available. • scion-bwtestclient: it is the only application presented in this work that is not installed by default in the VM. Bwtestclientis part of a bigger bandwidth testing applica- tion named bwtesterwhich allows a variety of bandwidth tests on the SCION network. The application enables speci- fication of the test duration (up to 10 seconds), the packet size to be used (at least 4 bytes), the total number of packets that will be sent, and the target bandwidth. For example, 5,100,?,150Mbps specifies that the packet size is 100 bytes, sent over 5 seconds, resulting in a bandwidth of 150Mbps. The question mark ? character can be used as wildcard for any of these parameters, in this case the number of packets sent. Its value is then computed according to the other pa- rameters. The parameters for the test in the client-to-server direction are specified with -cs, and the server-to-client direction with -sc. We will analyze further these scion commands and how we used them in the next section. 4 SOFTWARE DESIGN We now present our software to test SCION features of path aware- ness and path selection.

Instead, network operators have to incentivize end-hosts to adopt one of the well-known convergent path-selection strategies with stabilization mechanisms . These mechanisms have to be incentive-compatible, i.e., the mechanisms must create an in- centive structure such that it is in an end-host’s self-interest to adopt a non-oscillatory path-selection strategy. In this work, we present two such stabilization mechanisms, FLOSS and CROSS, and formally prove their incentive compatibility. These mechanisms employ different techniques to disincentivize oscillatory switching between paths, namely limiting the migration rate between paths (FLOSS) and imposing a cost on switching between paths (CROSS). To complement our mainly theoretical work, we also discuss how our findings could be practically applied. 1.1 Contribution This paper revisits the theoretical study of the dynamic effects of end-point path selection, for the first time focusing the analysis on inter-domain networks where the end-points are selfish and uncontrolled. We present a game-theoretic model that allows us to investigate which path-selection strategies will be adopted by selfish end-hosts. In particular, we introduce the notion of equi- libria to path-selection strategies (PSS equilibria). Moreover, we formally show that the non-oscillatory path-selection strategies proposed in the existing literature do not form such PSS equilibria. Thus, we provide evidence towards the hypothesis that stability in load-adaptive routing over multiple domains cannot be achieved by exclusively relying on end-hosts’ path-selection behavior. To rem- edy this problem, we leverage insights from mechanism design to devise two incentive-compatible stabilization mechanisms enforced by network operators. While these mechanisms build on existing insights from intra-domain traffic engineering, their methods of incentivization represent a novel approach to achieve stability in inter-domain networks with load-adaptive routing. We formally prove the incentive compatibility of both mechanisms and discuss their practical application. 2 OSCILLATION MODEL 2.1 Parallel-Path Systems In order to study oscillation in network architectures with end-host path selection, we build on the well-established Wardrop model [37], which is the standard model for studying the interactions of selfish agents in computer networks [28, 32, 33]. In the Wardrop model, an infinite number of end-hosts, each controlling an infinitesimal traffic share, select one path 𝜋 among multiple paths Π between two network nodes. Every path 𝜋 has a load-dependent cost, where the path-cost function 𝑐𝜋 is typically interpreted as latency. The end-hosts’ path-selection decisions form a congestion game, where the path-selection decisions of end-hosts both determine and follow the load 𝑓𝜋 on every path 𝜋 [5, 19, 30]. In this work, we analyze congestion games with a temporal com- ponent, i.e., end-hosts take path-selection decisions over time based on currently available information. More precisely, an end-host performs an average of 𝑟 > 0 re-evaluations per unit of time. The aggregate re-evaluation behavior is uniform over time, i.e., when dividing time into intervals of length 𝜖 ∈(0,1], 𝑟𝜖 re-evaluations are performed in any interval Whenever an end-host performs a re-evaluation, it chooses one path 𝜋to its destination according to a freely chosen path-selection strategy 𝜎. We thus formalize the environment of congestion games as parallel-path systems : Definition 1. A parallel-path system 𝑂 := (Π,𝑟,𝑝,𝑇,𝐴 0,𝑣) is a tuple, where a total demand normalized to 1 is distributed over parallel paths 𝜋 ∈Π among which end-hosts can select; 𝑟 > 0 is the average number of re-evaluations per end-host and unit of time; 𝑝 ≥ 1 is the steepness of the path cost as a function of the load (i.e., 𝑐𝜋 = (𝑓𝜋)𝑝); 𝑇 ≥0 is the average time that it takes for cost information to reach the agents; A0 ∈ [0,1]|Π| is the initial load matrix, where the entry A0𝜋 = 𝑓𝜋(0); and 𝑣 is the strategy profile, defining for every available path-selection strategy 𝜎 the share 𝑣(𝜎) of end-hosts that permanently apply strategy 𝜎. Every congestion game possesses at least one Wardrop equilib- rium, consisting of a traffic distribution where no single agent can reduce its cost by selecting an alternative path [30]. If the agents take path-selection decisions based on up-to-date cost information of paths (𝑇 = 0), convergence to Wardrop equilibria is guaranteed and persistent oscillations can thus not arise [12, 13, 34]. However, in practice, the cost information possessed by agents isstale (𝑇 > 0), i.e., the information describes an older state of the network. If such stale information is present, undesirable oscillations can arise [14]. Therefore, parallel-path systems can be oscillation-prone: Definition 2. A parallel-path system 𝑂 is oscillation-prone if and only if 𝑇 > 0. In this work, we study oscillation-prone systems with two paths 𝛼 and 𝛽 (i.e., |Π|= 2), but our insights directly generalize to more paths. Due to total demand normalization, it holds that 𝑓𝛽(𝑡)= 1 −𝑓𝛼(𝑡)for all 𝑡 ≥0. Thus, the unique Wardrop equilibrium in a two-path oscillation-prone system is given by 𝑓𝛼 = 𝑓𝛽 = 1/2. Moreover, we assume w.l.o.g. that the initial imbalance𝐴0 exists with the higher load on path 𝛼: 𝑓𝛼(0)= 𝐴0 = A0𝛼 > 1/2. For this system of two parallel paths, ˜𝜋 denotes the respective other path, i.e., ˜𝛼 = 𝛽 and ˜𝛽 = 𝛼. Having introduced the concept of oscillation-prone systems, we next define notions of oscillation and stability. First, an oscillation- prone system experiences oscillation if the traffic distribution does not eventually become static: Definition 3. An oscillation-prone system 𝑂experiences oscilla- tion if there exists no limit Δ∗of the function Δ(𝑡)= |𝑓𝛼(𝑡)− 𝑓𝛽(𝑡)| for 𝑡 →∞. Conversely, we understand stability simply as the absence of oscillation, i.e., stability is given if a limit Δ∗exists. However, to ensure optimal network utilization, the desirable state of the net- work is not only stability, but stability at equal load as given by the Wardrop equilibrium: Definition 4. An oscillation-prone system 𝑂 is stable at equal load if Δ∗:= lim𝑡→∞Δ(𝑡)= 0. 2 </content>' - 'Research paper section providing a Z-lane system description.

The decision how to configure the rates is ultimately up to the network operator and, importantly, does not require any inter-domain coordination. Due to the aggregation of ASes into ISDs, configurations remain manageable even if the Internet grows to hundreds of thousands of ASes. End Host Guarantees. Z-Lane lets end hosts, more specifi- cally their applications, define what traffic should be sent with forwarding guarantees, and what traffic should be forwarded over best-effort. Still, to protect against malicious end hosts, their AS has the ultimate authority in this matter and can re- classify traffic to be sent as best-effort only. This protection is implemented through a Z-Lane gateway, which schedules end host traffic and authenticates it towards on-path routers using a secret key not known to the end hosts. How traffic is scheduled is up to the AS operator; configurations can range from fair sharing to prioritizing certain traffic from critical AS services like routing or time synchronization. We emphasize that, to avoid any setup overhead (R3), neither ISDs, nor ASes or end hosts explicitly learn their configured rate; instead, end hosts implicitly discover their allowed rate through existing mechanisms like congestion control. Compatibility with Other Systems. Bandwidth reserva- tion systems cannot provide zero-setup communication guar- antees and are therefore not suitable to protect short-lived intermediate-rate communication (Section 8). Still, we design Z-Lane to seamlessly coexist with them, as they complement our work by effectively protecting non-setup-critical, high- volume communication such as from video conferencing. We choose COLIBRI [27] as a reservation system instantiation, but other systems could be deployed as well. To prevent at- tacks targeting DRKey’s AS-level key exchange, which is a fundamental requirement for EPIC, our design also ensures compatibility with the DoCile system [74], which leverages dedicated channels between neighboring ASes to successfully bootstrap the key exchange even under DDoS. We therefore consider the following four types of inter- domain traffic: COLIBRI reservation traffic, DoCile’s neighbor-based communication, authenticated traffic from EPIC, and unauthenticated SCION traffic. 4.2 Source Authentication Z-Lane employs EPIC for authenticating traffic sources to border routers, allowing every border router to verify the au- thenticity of every received packet. An important insight in the design of Z-Lane is that efficient and reliable source authen- tication as provided by EPIC allows for meaningful source- based traffic control at border routers. The realization of this idea has not been possible so far because previous source authentication mechanisms would cause excessive commu- nication or computation overhead and therefore impede de- ployment, or were based on heuristics or probabilities, and would thus fail to reliably distinguish between authentic and spoofed addresses (Appendix H). Z-Lane is the first system to explore the use of comprehensive source authentication to protect the availability of short-lived intermediate-rate Inter- net traffic – with EPIC’s security rooted in AS-level secret keys, it integrates seamlessly into Z-Lane. We want to highlight that EPIC together with a fairness mechanism provided by some congestion control algorithm, i.e., without any guaranteed rates, would not be enough in our threat model, as an attacker would just not respect the algorithm’s feedback and instead keep sending traffic at high rates, or leverage a botnet to create many low-volume flows. 4.3 End Host Traffic Generation End hosts, i.e., their applications, can choose among several mechanisms on how their traffic is forwarded (Figure 1). For long-term traffic they request a bandwidth reservation and use it by sending their COLIBRI traffic class packets through the COLIBRI gateway. While the overhead for requesting a reservation is significant, the result is a fixed amount of bandwidth that is exclusively reserved along the communi- cation path. In a similar way, applications send short-lived intermediate-rate traffic using the EPIC traffic class over the Z-Lane gateway, where traffic is forwarded immediately with- out any delay (requirement R3), but without the applications knowing the concrete rates. In both cases traffic is protected against congestion on the communication path. The default option is for end hosts to send their traffic using the EPIC traffic class directly to a border router of their AS, where they are forwarded along the path using best-effort. This option is useful for non-latency-critical communication such as file downloads, or for long-term traffic for which no reservation is available, which can for example happen if the end host has already created a large number of reservations and gets denied from creating even more. Z-Lane envisages unauthenticated SCION traffic to be sent only in scenarios where it is not otherwise possible, e.g., if an AS needs to request shared keys using DRKey from another AS for the first time. 4.4 Z-Lane Gateway ASes use the gateway to control the traffic volumes that their end hosts (incl. AS infrastructure services) are allowed to send using Z-Lane, which serves the primary purpose of protecting benign from malicious or compromised end hosts. For end host traffic complying with the allowed rate, the gateway sets a QoS flag in the EPIC header, which indicates to on-path routers that the corresponding packets should be forwarded using the AS’ guaranteed rate. If an end host’s packet exceeds the allowed rate at the gateway, then either (i) the QoS flag is not set (or removed, if it was already set by the end host), meaning that those packets will be treated as best- effort, or (ii) the packets are dropped, depending on the AS’ policy. In contrast to best-effort EPIC packets generated at 5 </content>' pipeline_tag: sentence-similarity library_name: sentence-transformers metrics: - cosine_accuracy@1 - cosine_accuracy@3 - cosine_accuracy@5 - cosine_accuracy@10 - cosine_precision@1 - cosine_precision@3 - cosine_precision@5 - cosine_precision@10 - cosine_recall@1 - cosine_recall@3 - cosine_recall@5 - cosine_recall@10 - cosine_ndcg@10 - cosine_mrr@10 - cosine_map@100 model-index: - name: SentenceTransformer based on Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s results: - task: type: information-retrieval name: Information Retrieval dataset: name: val ir eval type: val-ir-eval metrics: - type: cosine_accuracy@1 value: 0.7254901960784313 name: Cosine Accuracy@1 - type: cosine_accuracy@3 value: 0.9019607843137255 name: Cosine Accuracy@3 - type: cosine_accuracy@5 value: 0.9313725490196079 name: Cosine Accuracy@5 - type: cosine_accuracy@10 value: 0.9607843137254902 name: Cosine Accuracy@10 - type: cosine_precision@1 value: 0.7254901960784313 name: Cosine Precision@1 - type: cosine_precision@3 value: 0.3006535947712418 name: Cosine Precision@3 - type: cosine_precision@5 value: 0.18627450980392155 name: Cosine Precision@5 - type: cosine_precision@10 value: 0.09607843137254901 name: Cosine Precision@10 - type: cosine_recall@1 value: 0.7254901960784313 name: Cosine Recall@1 - type: cosine_recall@3 value: 0.9019607843137255 name: Cosine Recall@3 - type: cosine_recall@5 value: 0.9313725490196079 name: Cosine Recall@5 - type: cosine_recall@10 value: 0.9607843137254902 name: Cosine Recall@10 - type: cosine_ndcg@10 value: 0.8542256235274797 name: Cosine Ndcg@10 - type: cosine_mrr@10 value: 0.8187908496732025 name: Cosine Mrr@10 - type: cosine_map@100 value: 0.8212133545466878 name: Cosine Map@100 --- # SentenceTransformer based on Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s This is a sentence-transformers model finetuned from Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s.
