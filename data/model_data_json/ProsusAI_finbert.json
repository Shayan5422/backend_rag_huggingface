    "description": "--- language: \"en\" tags: - financial-sentiment-analysis - sentiment-analysis widget: - text: \"Stocks rallied and the British pound gained.\" --- FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text. It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain, using a large financial corpus and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment classification. Financial PhraseBank by Malo et al. (2014) is used for fine-tuning. For more details, please see the paper FinBERT: Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained Language Models and our related blog post on Medium. The model will give softmax outputs for three labels: positive, negative or neutral. --- About Prosus Prosus is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world.
