    "description": "--- license: mit tags: - audio - text-to-speech datasets: - libritts --- # SpeechT5 (TTS task) SpeechT5 model fine-tuned for speech synthesis (text-to-speech) on LibriTTS. This model was introduced in SpeechT5: Unified-Modal Encoder-Decoder Pre-Training for Spoken Language Processing by Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei. SpeechT5 was first released in this repository, original weights. The license used is MIT. ## Model Description Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder. Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder. Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification. - **Developed by:** Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei. - **Shared by [optional]:** Matthijs Hollemans - **Model type:** text-to-speech - **Language(s) (NLP):** [More Information Needed] - **License:** MIT - **Finetuned from model [optional]:** [More Information Needed] ## Model Sources [optional] <!-- Provide the basic links for the model. --> - **Repository:** [ - **Paper:** [ - **Blog Post:** [ - **Demo:** [ # Uses <!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. --> ## ðŸ¤— Transformers Usage You can run SpeechT5 TTS locally with the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. 1. First install the ðŸ¤— Transformers library, sentencepiece, soundfile and datasets(optional): 2. Run inference via the (TTS) pipeline. You can access the SpeechT5 model via the TTS pipeline in just a few lines of code! 3. Run inference via the Transformers modelling code - You can use the processor + generate code to convert text into a mono 16 kHz speech waveform for more fine-grained control. ### Fine-tuning the Model Refer to this Colab notebook for an example of how to fine-tune SpeechT5 for TTS on a different dataset or a new language. ## Direct Use <!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. --> You can use this model for speech synthesis.
