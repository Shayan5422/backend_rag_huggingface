However, developing these tools for different languages requires data that is not always available. This paper collects the available emotion detection datasets across 19 languages. We train a multilingual emotion prediction model for social media data, XLM-EMO. The model shows competitive performance in a zero-shot setting, suggesting it is helpful in the context of low-resource languages. We release our model to the community so that interested researchers can directly use it. ## Model This model is the fine-tuned version of the XLM-T model. ### Intended Use The model is intended as a research output for research communities. #### Primary intended uses The primary intended users of these models are AI researchers. ## Results This model had an F1 of 0.85 on the test set. ## License For models, restrictions may apply to the data (which are derived from existing datasets) or Twitter (main data source).
