    "description": "--- license: apache-2.0 library_name: timm --- # WD ViT-Large Tagger v3 Supports ratings, characters and general tags. Trained using TPUs used for training kindly provided by the TRC program. ## Dataset Last image id: 7220105 Trained on Danbooru images with IDs modulo 0000-0899. Validated on images with IDs modulo 0950-0999. Images with less than 10 general tags were filtered out. Tags with less than 600 images were filtered out. ## Validation results ## What's new Model v1.0/Dataset v3: More training images, more and up-to-date tags (up to 2024-02-28). Now compatible! Load it up and give it a spin using the canonical one-liner! ONNX model is compatible with code developed for the v2 series of models. The batch dimension of the ONNX model is not fixed to 1 anymore. Now you can go crazy with batch inference. Switched to Macro-F1 to measure model performance since it gives me a better gauge of overall training progress. # Runtime deps ONNX model requires # Inference code examples For timm: For ONNX: For JAX: ## Final words Subject to change and updates. Downstream users are encouraged to use tagged releases rather than relying on the head of the repo.",
