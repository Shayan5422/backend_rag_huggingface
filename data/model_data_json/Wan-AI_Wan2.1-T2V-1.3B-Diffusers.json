The parameters and configurations for these models are as follows: <table> <thead> <tr> <th rowspan=\"2\">Task</th> <th colspan=\"2\">Resolution</th> <th rowspan=\"2\">Model</th> </tr> <tr> <th>480P</th> <th>720P</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>t2v-14B</td> <td style=\"color: green;\">‚úîÔ∏è</td> <td style=\"color: green;\">‚úîÔ∏è</td> <td>Wan2.1-T2V-14B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>t2v-1.3B</td> <td style=\"color: green;\">‚úîÔ∏è</td> <td style=\"color: red;\">‚ùå</td> <td>Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> ##### (1) Without Prompt Extention To facilitate implementation, we will start with a basic version of the inference process that skips the prompt extension step. - Single-GPU inference If you encounter OOM (Out-of-Memory) issues, you can use the and options to reduce GPU memory usage. For example, on an RTX 4090 GPU: > üí°Note: If you are using the model, we recommend setting the parameter . The can be adjusted within the range of 8 to 12 based on the performance. - Multi-GPU inference using FSDP + xDiT USP Wan can also be run directly using ü§ó Diffusers! ##### (2) Using Prompt Extention Extending the prompts can effectively enrich the details in the generated videos, further enhancing the video quality. Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension: - Use the Dashscope API for extension. - Apply for a in advance (EN | CN). - Configure the environment variable to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud's international site, you also need to set the environment variable to ' For more detailed instructions, please refer to the dashscope document. - Use the model for text-to-video tasks and for image-to-video tasks. - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter . For example: - Using a local model for extension. - By default, the Qwen model on HuggingFace is used for this extension. Users can choose based on the available GPU memory size. - For text-to-video tasks, you can use models like , and - For image-to-video tasks, you can use models like and . - Larger models generally provide better extension results but require more GPU memory. - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter , allowing you to specify either a local model path or a Hugging Face model.

These include our novel spatio-temporal variational autoencoder (VAE), scalable training strategies, large-scale data construction, and automated evaluation metrics. Collectively, these contributions enhance the model‚Äôs performance and versatility. ##### (1) 3D Variational Autoencoders We propose a novel 3D causal VAE architecture, termed **Wan-VAE** specifically designed for video generation. By combining multiple strategies, we improve spatio-temporal compression, reduce memory usage, and ensure temporal causality. **Wan-VAE** demonstrates significant advantages in performance efficiency compared to other open-source VAEs. Furthermore, our **Wan-VAE** can encode and decode unlimited-length 1080P videos without losing historical temporal information, making it particularly well-suited for video generation tasks. <div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"assets/video_vae_res.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 80%;\" /> </div> ##### (2) Video Diffusion DiT **Wan2.1** is designed using the Flow Matching framework within the paradigm of mainstream Diffusion Transformers. Our model's architecture uses the T5 Encoder to encode multilingual text input, with cross-attention in each transformer block embedding the text into the model structure. Additionally, we employ an MLP with a Linear layer and a SiLU layer to process the input time embeddings and predict six modulation parameters individually. This MLP is shared across all transformer blocks, with each block learning a distinct set of biases. Our experimental findings reveal a significant performance improvement with this approach at the same parameter scale. <div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"assets/video_dit_arch.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 80%;\" /> </div> | Model | Dimension | Input Dimension | Output Dimension | Feedforward Dimension | Frequency Dimension | Number of Heads | Number of Layers | |--------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------| | 1.3B | 1536 | 16 | 16 | 8960 | 256 | 12 | 30 | | 14B | 5120 | 16 | 16 | 13824 | 256 | 40 | 40 | ##### Data We curated and deduplicated a candidate dataset comprising a vast amount of image and video data. During the data curation process, we designed a four-step data cleaning process, focusing on fundamental dimensions, visual quality and motion quality. Through the robust data processing pipeline, we can easily obtain high-quality, diverse, and large-scale training sets of images and videos. !figure1 ##### Comparisons to SOTA We compared **Wan2.1** with leading open-source and closed-source models to evaluate the performace. Using our carefully designed set of 1,035 internal prompts, we tested across 14 major dimensions and 26 sub-dimensions. Then we calculated the total score through a weighted average based on the importance of each dimension. The detailed results are shown in the table below. These results demonstrate our model's superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models. !figure1 ## Citation If you find our work helpful, please cite us. ## License Agreement The models in this repository are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
