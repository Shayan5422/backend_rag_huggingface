ColPali is a model based on a novel model architecture and training strategy based on Vision Language Models (VLMs) to efficiently index documents from their visual features. It is a PaliGemma-3B extension that generates ColBERT- style multi-vector representations of text and images. It was introduced in the paper ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models and first released in this repository <p align=\"center\"><img width=800 src=\" ## Version specificity This version is trained with but can be loaded for any version . Compared to []( this version is trained with right padding for queries to fix unwanted tokens in the query encoding. It also stems from the fixed to guarantee deterministic projection layer initialization. It was trained for 5 epochs, with in-batch negatives and hard mined negatives and a warmup of 1000 steps (10x longer) to help reduce non-english language collapse. Data is the same as the ColPali data described in the paper. ## Model Description This model is built iteratively starting from an off-the-shelf SigLIP model. We finetuned it to create BiSigLIP and fed the patch-embeddings output by SigLIP to an LLM, PaliGemma-3B to create BiPali. One benefit of inputting image patch embeddings through a language model is that they are natively mapped to a latent space similar to textual input (query). This enables leveraging the ColBERT strategy to compute interactions between text tokens and image patches, which enables a step-change improvement in performance compared to BiPali. ## Model Training ### Dataset Our training dataset of 127,460 query-page pairs is comprised of train sets of openly available academic datasets (63%) and a synthetic dataset made up of pages from web-crawled PDF documents and augmented with VLM-generated (Claude-3 Sonnet) pseudo-questions (37%). Our training set is fully English by design, enabling us to study zero-shot generalization to non-English languages. We explicitly verify no multi-page PDF document is used both *ViDoRe* and in the train set to prevent evaluation contamination. A validation set is created with 2% of the samples to tune hyperparameters. *Note: Multilingual data is present in the pretraining corpus of the language model (Gemma-2B) and potentially occurs during PaliGemma-3B's multimodal training.* ### Parameters All models are trained for 1 epoch on the train set. Unless specified otherwise, we train models in format, use low-rank adapters (LoRA) with and on the transformer layers from the language model, as well as the final randomly initialized projection layer, and use a optimizer. We train on an 8 GPU setup with data parallelism, a learning rate of 5e-5 with linear decay with 2.5% warmup steps, and a batch size of 32. ## Usage Install []( Then run the following code: ## Limitations - **Focus**: The model primarily focuses on PDF-type documents and high-ressources languages, potentially limiting its generalization to other document types or less represented languages. - **Support**: The model relies on multi-vector retreiving derived from the ColBERT late interaction mechanism, which may require engineering efforts to adapt to widely used vector retrieval frameworks that lack native multi-vector support. ## License ColPali's vision language backbone model (PaliGemma) is under license as specified in its model card. The adapters attached to the model are under MIT license. ## Contact - Manuel Faysse: manuel.faysse@illuin.tech - Hugues Sibille: hugues.sibille@illuin.tech - Tony Wu: tony.wu@illuin.tech ## Citation If you use any datasets or models from this organization in your research, please cite the original dataset as follows:"
