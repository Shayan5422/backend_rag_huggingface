Evalutation without a language model gives the following: WER for NST + Common Voice test set (2% of total sentences) is **2.5%**. WER for Common Voice test set is **8.49%** directly and **7.37%** with a 4-gram language model. When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz. **Update 2022-01-10:** Updated to VoxRex-C version. **Update 2022-05-16:** Paper is is here. # Performance\\* !Comparison <center><del>*<i>Chart shows performance without the additional 20k steps of Common Voice fine-tuning</i></del></center> ## Training This model has been fine-tuned for 120000 updates on NST + CommonVoice<del> and then for an additional 20000 updates on CommonVoice only. The additional fine-tuning on CommonVoice hurts performance on the NST+CommonVoice test set somewhat and, unsurprisingly, improves it on the CommonVoice test set. It seems to perform generally better though [citation needed]</del>. !WER during training ## Usage The model can be used directly (without a language model) as follows: ## Citation",
