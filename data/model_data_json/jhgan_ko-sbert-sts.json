    "description": "--- pipeline_tag: sentence-similarity tags: - sentence-transformers - feature-extraction - sentence-similarity - transformers --- # ko-sbert-sts This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search. <!--- Describe your model here --> ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers) Using this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed: Then you can use the model like this: ## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers) Without sentence-transformers, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings. ## Evaluation Results <!--- Describe how your model was evaluated --> KorSTS 학습 데이터셋으로 학습한 후 KorSTS 평가 데이터셋으로 평가한 결과입니다. - Cosine Pearson: 81.55 - Cosine Spearman: 81.23 - Euclidean Pearson: 79.94 - Euclidean Spearman: 79.79 - Manhattan Pearson: 79.90 - Manhattan Spearman: 79.75 - Dot Pearson: 76.02 - Dot Spearman: 75.31 ## Training The model was trained with the parameters: **DataLoader**: of length 719 with parameters: **Loss**: Parameters of the fit()-Method: ## Full Model Architecture ## Citing & Authors <!--- Describe where people can find more information --> - Ham, J., Choe, Y.
