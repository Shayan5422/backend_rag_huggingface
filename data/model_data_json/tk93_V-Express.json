(It is also available from the original model card facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h) ### Face Analysis - model_ckpts/insightface_models/models/buffalo_l. (It is also available from the original repository insightface/buffalo_l) ### V-Express - model_ckpts/sd-vae-ft-mse. VAE encoder. (original model card stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse) - model_ckpts/stable-diffusion-v1-5. Only the model configuration file for unet is needed here. (original model card runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) - model_ckpts/v-express. The video generation model conditional on audio and V-kps we call V-Express. - You should download and put all model to directory, which includes , , , , and . ## licence see acknowledgements for more information.",
